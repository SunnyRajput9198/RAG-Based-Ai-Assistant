    "text": " Guys, I read the box model of my CSS. You saw that if the width of any element is less and the content inside it is more, then the items inside it overflow. We can manage this overflow by using the CSS overflow property. We can bring a scroll bar inside CSS horizontally and vertically. We will learn these things in this video. And we will also use it practically in the coming projects. I want you to keep high energy. Do write Sigma batch OP in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to my computer screen. As you can see, the first thing I am going to do here is to make a new folder. And I am going to name it video 26. And today's video is on our overflow property. What is this overflow property? Look, you have a box. You put such an item inside that box. Because it is bigger than that box. What will it do? It will overflow. It is obvious. Now how do you want the overflow to be handled in this way? It's up to you. For example, I have this box. It says, I am a good boy and I love to write lorem 45. Okay. Assume I wrote this. Obviously, you will write something good. Your meaningful content will be in the box. And by correcting it here and by putting a style tag, I will write a CSS in the dot box here. And I will tell you what that CSS will be. First of all, I will give it a width. Let's say I give it a width of 40bw. Okay. It got 40% width of their viewport width. And I will give it a height of 40bh. Okay. It got 40% of the viewport height. Okay. Now after this, I will give a border in it. And that will be 2px solid black. And the rest of you can see its preview here. How is it looking? Okay. Obviously, I will show you in the browser. Hey, this is not overflowed. So what will I do to make it overflow? I will make it 10bh 10bw. I will make it 10. Now I made it 10. So obviously it will overflow. Or if I make it 30bh 10bh, then see it is overflowing below. Now because it is overflowing, what will I do to fix it? So how can it be fixed? See it can be fixed in two ways. The first way to fix it is that I use the overflow property here. I say something like this overflow. And here I say scroll. Okay. So if I make it overflow scroll, then a horizontal scroll bar will come here. And the things that were overflowing from this box will not overflow. And obviously it will come here too. And you can see here that your work is done. So to put such a scroll bar, you can use overflow scroll. Now there are many other properties related to overflow. Like suppose if you have made overflow auto here. I can make it overflow auto here. And by making overflow auto, if it overflows, then you will see this scroll bar. And if it doesn't overflow, then you won't see the scroll bar. For example, if its viewport width is this much and its viewport height is this much, then there is no chance of overflow here. So by making overflow auto, overflow auto says that brother, if it overflows, then show the scroll bar. And if it is not overflowing, then you don't need to show the scroll bar. Let the element remain normal. This is our overflow auto. And if I say overflow scroll here, then even if everything is fine here, then what will happen here? You will get this scroll bar here. You will get to see this kind of scroll bar. That's why it's always a good idea to put a scroll bar. Okay, so I hope you understood this thing that why to put a scroll bar here. Now here if I had no wrapped its white space, let us say. That is, if I come to my code and write it here for you, I will make the white space no wrap. Okay, so what will happen by no wrapping? That by no wrapping the white space, it will take the whole space horizontally and the text will not fall vertically below. And if I do this and I will do a little less here. Let's say I do it a little 40. If I do 40, it will be so big and you can see the scroll bar here. That is, when I do no wrap the white space, it means that don't drop the text below. Now you see here if I put ellipses in overflow, I will show you by putting it here. Ellipses. Then you see here I have put ellipses in overflow. So after doing this, I can set one more property whose name is text overflow. And there is a value called ellipses in it by which these dots come. Like you can see here. So this happens by doing white space, no wrap and text overflow ellipses. Okay. I hope you understood this thing. Okay, so I will remove it once. I will do the format document and you understood. One thing to note here is that this is not overflow, it is text overflow. So you have to take care of this thing that overflow is different. Text overflow property is different. Here I have auto overflow. So that's why I am getting three dots here. If I would have hidden overflow, okay, then I would have seen three dots. And if I would have scrolled overflow, then I would have seen three dots here. You can see. Because I have told text overflow that do ellipses here. And if I remove ellipses from here, then you can see that this scroll bar has come here. I hope this thing is clear to you that how can you use text overflow property. After this, there is another value overflow clip, which you can use. This is a lot of hidden stuff. Overflow clip and overflow hidden are almost the same. The only difference is that the clip is programmatically scrolling which is also disabled. If you have put overflow clip, then you can't scroll programmatically. Now overflow can be handled individually. Like what I will do here is I will increase the text a little. And in fact, I will do one thing here that I will remove this white space that I had made. Because I want my content to look something like this. And you can see that I have just auto overflow. That is, my content is not overflowing. To make overflow, I will make its height a little smaller. I will also make its width a little smaller. I will make both 30x30. If I do 30x30, then it will overflow. Now I can control overflow x and overflow y separately. So I can say that make overflow x hidden. But if you do overflow in y, then scroll it. So I can put these properties individually. If I put these properties individually, then you can see overflow x, overflow y, by doing this, I am making overflow x hidden and scrolling overflow y. If I make overflow y hidden too, then it will hide here. So whatever was below it will be hidden. If I hide overflow y. Overflow x and overflow y can be written with the help of overflow shorthand. If I do not write all three, I will write it in this way that the overflow is hidden in x and auto in y. So you can see here that it is auto in y and hidden in x. But if I do it the other way around, that is, I say auto in y and hidden in x. Sorry, auto in x and hidden in y. So you can see here that it is hidden in y. So it is auto in x and hidden in y. So the first one is x and the second one is y. Now many people will ask how can I remember which is x and which is y. So you will do it. There is no need to remember anything like this. If you scroll it here and then hide it here, then you have scrolled overflow x. See, the scroll bar is visible. And if you scroll here too, then you will see the scroll bar here too. I will always recommend auto that you use it as much as possible because what happens by doing auto? If the scroll bar is needed, then it puts the scroll bar. Otherwise it does not put the scroll bar. What does it not do? It does not put the scroll bar. Okay, I hope you understood this thing. So that was all about the scrolling and overflow. I hope you understood how to add scroll bars. We will use it a lot when we make real-world websites. If you have not yet seen the playlist of the Sigma web development course, then do it. When will you do it? Click here to bookmark and click here to save. And the source code on GitHub I am updating regularly. I hope you are getting it. Thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time."
