    "text": " I have given you exercise 2 and I am so proud to say that many of you have solved it. In today's video, I am going to give you the solution of exercise 2. With high energy, do like this video because everything will be out and found in this video. I am really very excited. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, who will be the next episode of shoutout party, we are going to see the solution of exercise number 2. And let's see who has solved exercise number 2. And let me tell you guys, many people have solved exercise 2. And I will scroll down to see all your solutions. And after that, as soon as I scroll down, I will come back. So first of all, this was video number 20. By the way, someone suggested me to rename this video as tutorial 20 and make it 01. So I might do that. So if you get video 01 instead of video 1, then don't be surprised. So I will rename it. In fact, I did it. As you can see, now I will go to video 20 and see what it was. Because I have forgotten it a little bit. And I had written in the comment that what is the question. So if we see the question here, in fact, why not open it in VS Code. I will open video 20 with code and I will copy it here. And then this is our video number 27. So I will make a folder here in the name of video 27. New folder, video 27. And in video 27, I will open a new VS Code instance. And here I will make an index.html and put this thing in it. So let's talk about what was the question. The question is, write an HTML and CSS code to style a paragraph inside a div which contains 5 other paragraphs. So here is a div and inside the div you have 5 more paragraphs. And here you can see that the first paragraph must have a background color yellow and text color red. So this is the condition for the first paragraph. And the background color of all other paragraphs is blue and text color white. So to solve this problem, I will first put the background color of all my paragraphs in blue. By the way, I hit the control enter if you don't know. For example, your cursor is here and you want to bring it in a new line. I will keep telling you these things. Hit the control enter and it will come down. If your cursor is here, hit the control enter and it will come down. And here you can see that its background color is blue and text color is white. So the background color of all paragraphs will be blue and text color white. There are no surprises here. I will open it in the live server. Click here and open in browser. Or let's leave it here for now. We have to see the color. Then after this, what I will do is, I will say that the paragraph inside the div, I will say that if it is the first child, then what should I do? Then change the background color to red. Yellow and change the text color to red. So the first paragraph will be like this. And all the other paragraphs will be the same as we have styled. So this was a very simple one. People have also used the nth child pseudo selector. In the nth child, if the first child is p, then such a property will be applied on the paragraph. In the nth child, suppose you make it 2. So if p is the second child, then it will be applied. Let's say I do it and show you. Because we have come here to learn CSS. If I have made nth child 2 and I put it here, then you see the property will be applied on the second child. See, this means that you should apply this property on p when it is the second child of your parent. Okay, this is what it means. So I hope you understood this thing. But I will delete it because I want to give you a solution. So here CSS HTML code to style a paragraph inside a div which contains 5 other paragraphs. Now whether it has 5 other paragraphs or 10 other paragraphs or 20 other paragraphs, the first paragraph has to be made its background color yellow and text red, which has already happened. Background color yellow and text color red. And the background color of the rest of the paragraphs is blue and text color white. As you can see. The HTML is written below for your reference. Do not change this HTML. It's not that you have put inline slides, it's just that you have put inline slides. So let's go and give a shout out. In the next episode, let's go who will be the shout out husband. And here he has written without a hashtag Muhammad Hassan and I would like to see a big shout out to him. He did exactly what I did. He has made the background color blue and white by doing dev p. Like I did. Background color blue, color white p. And in fact, I have printed it all. I have not cheated, guys. Okay, don't think I have cheated his solution. I haven't. Exactly our solution is the same. So big shout out to Muhammad Hassan. Then Dev Dutt Paul. Let's see his solution. And here you can see that he has p first child, dev first child, p first child. There was no need to do dev first child. Because here what is there is if dev is the first child of your parent. I did not make sense of this thing. In fact, if I put their CSS here, then it will not work. I will show you. I will show you. I will comment my CSS. And I will put their CSS here. And you see their CSS is not working. So here we said that inside a div which contains five other paragraphs, the first paragraph must have background color yellow. So see the color of the one below is ruined. So his solution is wrong. But I liked his intent to learn. And big shout out to him. I hope you did not get confused. Then Rohit Jagtaab. 547 What did he do? He put a class. And you did not do well by putting a class. Because you changed the HTML. I wrote this in the question. That you cannot change HTML. But big shout out to Rohit Jagtaab. And you see your mistake. And in the coming questions, come up like a new player. After this, he has used p first child. And he did exactly what I did. Big shout out to Suraj Biswas. Then big shout out to Devendra Chauhan. He accepted the challenge. And here you can see he put an ID. MD Huzaif. Why did you put an ID? You should have put an inline style. But no problem. MD Huzaif will understand what I said. And we will implement it. And I hope that he will come up in the coming exercise like a better player. So he will come back very soon. I know. And let's see what is happening with Sumit Handa. Here he has targeted not first child. Yes, this will also work. You can target not first child. In fact, their CSS will also work. And we can actually check it. If they have not done anything wrong in the syntax, then it is working. But as I told you that you do one thing in all paragraphs. And do the rest like this. So big shout out to him. And I give shout out to other people who have given the solution. Then Shubham. And shout out to Sukesh. Without me. MD. Shout out to R.A. Hussain. Shout out to Arshad. Shout out to Hashir. Shout out to Shrest. Shout out to Tauseef. Shout out to Preetam. Shout out to Nitesh. Shout out to Mohit. Shout out to Aryan. Shout out to Rhea. Shout out to Vikas Gupta. Shout out to Pathan. Shout out to Bhaktawar. Now I have given shout out to everyone from below. Now I will give some random shout outs. I will give it to a user and again to a user. I want to give it to a study and Oribul Huq. Then I want to give it to Thor. I am not giving it to User. I am giving it to Prince. Shout out to User. Shout out to Samadhan Patil. Shout out to Umar. Shout out to Ranjit. Shout out to Hussler. Shout out to Sai Chhant. And I hope you liked this exercise. I scroll it so that everyone's name is at least If I am not giving a shoutout, then it will splash on the screen. I know that many people will get dizzy by seeing this But you see it, you see it, you see it By the way, if you don't know, then if you press the mouse wheel in the middle and press your mouse on top, then it scrolls like this And it comes in handy during recording When I want to record a video and use it during editing But I went a little out of context If you have not accessed this playlist yet, then do access it Along with that, I am updating the source code on GitHub Sometimes I get half an hour late Sometimes I forget, it happens very rarely that I get one day late in putting the source code So you don't worry about it at all, you will get it By the way, I merged the pull request that someone had put, I liked this description very much If you want to make it better, you can put a pull request But I will tell you not to focus on this thing Focus now on learning web development Our first focus in the Sigma web development course is to learn web development So you focus on that So I hope you guys are enjoying it here You must be feeling good about doing this course How is it looking? I want you to go to this course And go to this course and tell me in the first video of this course That how is this course Go here and give me 5 stars for those who are going to start this course So I will put the source code here by pushing it And here you will get all their names updated I have actually changed this name And I have also made a video on 0102 It was actually a good idea Big shout out to whoever gave me I hope you guys are enjoying this course Thank you so much guys for watching this video And I will see you next time"
