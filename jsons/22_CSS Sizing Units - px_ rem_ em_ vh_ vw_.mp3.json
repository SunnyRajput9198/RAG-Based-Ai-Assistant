    "text": " In CSS, you will get to see different types of sizing units. Sometimes you will get to see pixels, sometimes you will get to see VH, sometimes you will get to see VW, sometimes you will get to see RAM, you will get to see M. Which unit do you want to use? Which is the best among these? Which one do you want to avoid? And what do these units mean? This will be the topic of this video. Let's go to the computer screen. I am really very excited. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I am in my computer screen. And the thing I am going to tell you today is very dangerous. And you will enjoy it after learning it. Because it is so much used for sizing. It is so much used that you can make any website. It will always be good to know about sizing for you. Here I will do shift right click. And after doing shift right click, I will make a new folder here. In fact, to make a new folder, I will do something like this. And after this, I will do shift right click, open with code, and after this, I will do shift right click, open with code, I will make a file named index.html. And I will tell you here. So see, if you have a box. I wrote div.box here. And here it is written, this is a box. Okay. And suppose I gave a very basic style to it. I said, brother, give the border to my box. 2 pixels, solid black. And make its width 233 pixels. So what are pixels? Pixels are units that I used here. Is there only a unit called pixel? No. We have a lot of units to use in CSS. You can use any type of unit. And which unit to use when? It will depend on what you are doing. For example, if you want to set your height according to viewport height of an element, then you can do that too. And I will tell you this thing here. So first of all, if you don't want to access the playlist, then do it. Very few people have accessed the playlist from those who are watching. That's why I'm saying this again and again. And a lot of people also write source code. Where is it? Where is it? You guys watch the video, that's why I'm telling you again and again. I hope you guys have also got the source code. Now let's preview it. So this is the box I wrote. I said, brother, its width. Make it 200 pixels. If you want, you can also put background black in it. Sorry, let's say you put aquamarine in it. Okay. Now one unit is our pixel. I will tell you about some more units. The pixel is 196th of an inch. So if I wrote 233 pixels here, then you can see here that its width will be set accordingly. Now I will do one thing here. I will put a universal selector here. And by putting a universal selector, I will make M0 here. Okay. Writing M0 makes the margin zero. And writing P0 makes the padding zero. So here the margin padding by default is zero. Now my monitor is a 2K monitor. 2K monitor resolution. If I see the resolution of the 2K monitor here, how much is it? Its width is 2048 pixels. Okay. So if I make it 2048 pixels, 2048 pixels. So you guys see here that it has taken the full width. And a little bit of a scroll bar has also come. Maybe a little bit of a very light border. Because of that. If I do box sizing border box here, box sizing border box. And if I show you, then see this horizontal scroll bar also went. Okay. Now if I show you by inspecting it rightly. And if I increase it by one pixel. So see here. A horizontal scroll bar has come. So exactly my width of 2048 pixels is here. Okay. I hope you guys understood this thing. So this is what the pixel means. Now if you said that the width is 2048 pixels. Okay. And you go to a small device, which does not have such a big monitor. Okay. Suppose you have a 1080p monitor, whose default width is I think 1920x1080. That is, its height is 1080 and width is 1920. What will happen in this? In that, your website code will burst. So you don't want your website code to burst. That's why you will use a responsive unit. So I told you a unit in pixel. We will not use this. We will say that its width is 100vw. Vw means viewport width. That is, it will take the width of your viewport. What will happen if I increase it? Obviously, if I increase it, then a horizontal scroll bar will come. You can see. And let me show you one thing. As I told you in some of the initial videos, that you can right click, inspect and click here. You can click on this TV that you can see here. And as soon as you click on it, and if you choose responsive from here, then you will do it like this. You can't see the scroll bar. Because its width has been measured in the unit of vh. Because its width has been measured in the unit of vh. That's why you didn't see the horizontal scroll bar here. Okay. So you can do this thing. Now if I don't want to use vh. You can see a big advantage of using vh. That the horizontal scroll bar does not come here. Okay. So sometimes you want your element to be equal to its viewport width. Or let's say you want it to be 80vw. If I do 80vw, then you see here. Your container will come like this. Many times you have to do this. You want to center a particular thing. Like let's say I want to center this div. And I want to make it 80vw here. So what I will do in this case is I will auto its margin. What does margin auto mean? If I do margin auto. Margin auto. Margin auto means that I want to automatically apply margin from left and right. And from margin auto, your div will automatically apply margin from left and right. So your div will be centered. Now look here. By doing margin auto, it will be centered. But you have to keep one thing in mind. If you apply margin auto on it, it will be centered only when it is a block level element. If it is an inline element, then it will not be centered. I will show you by doing it. Let's say this box is a span. Okay. Let's say. So first of all, you can't apply width on it. And the second thing is that you can't do anything like this. You can't say that its margin auto. So I will tell you the solution to this problem in the coming videos. But you can center it like this. Let's say I want to make another box. I want to say that this was my nav bar. Now I want to make a container. And I want to give the same width to this container. Which I gave above. So if you see here, if I want to give the same width to it, then obviously I will do one thing. I will apply exactly the same thing on it. And maybe I want to give the margin top of 23 pixels. So whenever you want to separate the horizontal and vertical margin, then you can use margin shorthand property by giving a space. The 23 pixels here are the margin of the top and bottom. And auto means auto from left and right. So you see, 23 pixels are applied to the top and bottom. Now because there is nothing in the container, I will write 56 and you will tell me in the comment why I wrote 56. What was the reason to write 56. I will do it in the format document. And here you see that I have made two boxes. And exactly the width of these is the same. If I see this in an iPhone, suppose in iPhone 12 Pro. Actually I don't have 12 Pro. I have 13. And 15 is also coming. Many people were asking for an update for that. They are not giving it. It's been so long since I ordered it. I don't know what will happen. Now you can see that this is what it looks like on the phone. If I make it responsive, then it will adapt like this. So we have seen a very small taste of responsive design. But a lot is yet to come. We are going to do a lot of things from the perspective of responsive design. So this is not all. We will see more things in the coming videos. Now after this, I want to tell you about VH. If I want the height of this container to be 80% of the height of my viewport. So I will make it 80 VH. So it took 80% of the height. And if I want it to take 10% of the height of the viewport. So what will I do to it? I will make the height 10 VH. So this is 10 VH height. And this is 80% of the viewport height. Now if I change the height of the viewport. If I change the height of the viewport. Something like this. Suppose I make it smaller. So it will take 80% of the viewport height. And the one below will take 80% of the viewport height. So VH and VW are very important units. Pixel is our universal unit. Which we will keep using. And you can't avoid it. You have to use it. After this, Rem and M are very important units. So what is M? EM and Rem. So first of all I tell you about M. EM. Now let's say the font size of this container. I say font size. Let's say 1M. Now suppose the font size of this container. Is 16 pixels. Which is the default. It was going to be computed. I will make it a little more interesting. I will put a paragraph in it. And I will put this lorem in this paragraph. And you will know why I did this. Now I will put this font size in the paragraph. I will say the paragraph of the container. Font size of that. 1M. And I will do the font size of this. Font size. I will make it 16 pixels. Now you see carefully where things are going. Now see its font size is 16 pixels. So the paragraph will also inherit. Its font size. If I don't write this here. So here it is obvious that its font size will also be 16 pixels. Which is the default. If I make it 18 pixels. You see it is a little big. You can see it. So I changed its size. Now here. I will make its font size 1M. What will be its computed font size? You have to listen to me very carefully. Because understanding the m and m is very important. I will go to computed and search here. Font size. Now see here 18 pixels are coming. The size of the paragraph is 18 pixels. Because it will inherit from the container. Some properties inherit in CSS. And the font size is one of them. Property. So this property will inherit. And you can see here that. My font size is 18. So far so good. Now I tell you. If I write 1M. What will be the difference? There is no difference. Now if I make it 1.2M. Or let's say 1.5M. So the font size of this. It will be 1.5 times. That is, the value that was going to be inherited. 1.5 times. So you see here. 1.5 times 18. 27. So you see here. 36. So if I do 2. You see 36. I hope you understood this. What will be the font size of the container? Font size of the container. Will be the same as we have given. 18 pixels. So what does m mean? The font size that was going to be inherited. Its this much. Like if I do 1.5M. Or 2M. So the font size that was going to be inherited. Its 2 times. Now if I remove 18 pixels from here. So what will happen? It will be 2 times of 16. Because it was going to get 16 by default. So now the font size will be 32. So if you see the value in computed. You will get to see 32. I hope it is clear. Now I tell you the m. Now for some weird reason. Or for some good reason. I am making my website. Font size of the website. Let us say. Let us say I make my font size. 12 pixels. I said the font size of html is 12 pixels. So what will happen? Everything will be 12 pixels. See the font size of this is a box. It is inherited from html and it is 12 pixels. Now assume the font size of this. I want the font size of the root element. Which is html. By the way html is the root element. I want the font size of the root element. To double the font size. So how will I do this? I will write the rem. Rem means the amount of root element. That will be doubled. So if I will make it 2rem. Then what will happen? It will be 12 or 24 pixels. You can see here. I got 24 pixels. Rem means the amount of root element. That will be doubled. Em means the amount of root element. That will be doubled. See I said paragraph. That how much should I give? 2rem. Which is the double of the font size of the root element. By default it is 16. But I made it 12. So I got 24. If I make this rem as m. Then tell me in the comment section. How much font size will you get? And please keep 2 way interaction. You have to comment below. I am waiting for you. Now all the people commented 24. I said we will raise the bar. But many people commented wrong. I know. I will tell you where 24 came from. Font size property is inherent. So first of all. Head will get from html. Body will get from html. This div will get from body. What will be the font size of this div? 12. 12 pixels. What will happen to this paragraph? Because it was 12 pixels. So if I make it 2m. Then it will be 24. But if I make it 18. Now tell me in the comment section. What will be the font size of this div? And I am telling you the answer. The answer is 18x2. It will be 36. Because now it was going to get 36. But its double. If you still don't understand. Then I will tell you to watch the video. If you watch it twice. You will definitely understand. Are these the units? No, there are many other units. But what happens is that this is the most used unit. And if I tell you personally. Then I use these units to make my websites. Yes, there are two more units. Vmin and Vmax. You must have known from their name. But I will tell you practically. What is Vmin and Vmax? Sometimes what will happen is that. Your width will be greater than height. But in the phone, your height is greater than width. Is it or not? So if you are in the phone. Then your Vmin will be width. But if you are in the computer. Then your Vmin will be height. Because the height of the monitor is small. But the width of the phone is small. Do you understand? So what is the meaning of Vmin and Vmax? I tell you this. So if I say 100 Vmin. It means. 100 of whatever height and width. Will be the minimum. This minimum is this. If you are not understanding. I will do it. I will make another container. I will write here. I made a container in the name of mycont. I will write another container. And here I will style mycont. So I will write here. And here I will give it. Background color red. And I will give it color. What should I give? Yellow? I will give it. I will give it font size 22 pixels. You see that I made another container. Now I want to give its width. So I will say. Width is 100 Vmin. So if I do 100 Vmin. What will be the height? What is Vmin? Is Vmin height or width? Min will be for this. In my device. In the device I am making a video. What is Vmin? Vmin is height. 100 Vmin means 100 Vh. For this device. So you see here. It is 100 Vh. So should I write 100 Vmin or 100 Vh? Not always. In this device. Now what happens. If you want Vh in the phone. Vh in the phone. Vw in the computer. You are looking for Vmax. It is used in complex scenarios. Don't get confused. You should know Vmin and Vmax. So if I Here I have MyCont. It is 100 Vmin. If I write 100 Vh. Will it make any difference? No. Or I write 100 Vmin. In this device Vmin and Vmax are the same. And what will be my Vmin in my phone? Will it be Vh or Vw? Tell me in the comment section. I hope you have understood the concept of Vmin and Vmax. So this was about Vmin and Vmax. There are many more complex units. I am using the word complex. Because it is not used much. Your websites will be made of these units. And the rest. If I open the MDN docs. CSS MDN Docs. Reference for Vmin and Vmax. And I am writing here. Vmin and Vmax. And I am writing here. Vmin and Vmax. And I am writing here. Vmax. Reference for units. You will get to see many units. Here is Q, In, PC, PT. You will not remember all these units. But in this video I have told you. That matters. You are going to learn that matters. And if you need a reference. In which all the units are there. Here is the reference in front of you. You can screenshot it. What is M? There are many more units. But the most important. And that is the most useful. But in case you are looking for a comprehensive list. Here is the comprehensive list for you. And I will give you the link of this MDN. In this source code. So you have got the link of this MDN. So you have got the link of this MDN. So you have got the comprehensive list. But do not read this comprehensive list. I will recommend you this. My suggestion is that. You are getting this because. Do as much as I have told you in this video. As a beginner. Remembering so many units. Is not possible for a normal person. But if you take the challenge. You can do it. I am saying in normal scenarios. That it is not possible. I get a lot of people in the comments. Who are arguing. But you got the point. About what I am talking about. So this was all about units. I hope you are enjoying. Now I want to tell you. The concept of max width and min width. Or the concept of max height and min height. So if I come here. And I say that this is my container. And I want to make this container beautiful. First of all, I want to remove this background color. From reddish. And I will do box sizing. And along with that. The way I put this border. I will put it here too. And I will give the margin too. So that it becomes the center. And now it looks like this. As you can see. I will put the border here too. And I will make the color a little dark. I will make it black. And here you see. I will give the border too. I will copy it. And here I will give the border to this. Mycont container. So I have given the border here. There is no need to do the same. But again I have made it 100vmin. Which is fine. If I change the size. It will go out a little. But that's fine. I will make the width 100vw. Sorry 80vw. So that there is no confusion. And let me do one more thing. 80vw. Okay. So this is how it is made. We have made a very basic website. You can see here. This footer and main content. This website is made. By the way. Now you see here. I have written I am another container. I want to tell you a point. I want this container. To have some height. Or I will do one thing. I will do the same thing in this div. Because this is our main content of the website. Assume that you are putting some content here. So your website will look like this. Its height. If I remove the height from it. So you see what will happen. You see the footer is completely down. So you want that. Our box. Minimum height should be constant. What should be? Minimum height should be constant. And if I put more content than that. Then more height will be adjusted. So I will say. Do one thing. Minimum height. Min height. Min height. Keep 80vh. Whether there is content or not. So this is the height. But there is no limit to the maximum. Maximum content will increase. It will increase. I will show you. If I put a lot of lorems in it. In fact I put lorem 122. I don't know how much text is this. It is very less text. It is less text. So I want to fill it. I do one thing. I do lorem 123. I know it is a lot of text. I know it is a lot of text. It is a lot of text. And see our website is adjusted. Our website is adjusted. And see our box. Its height is adjusted. And as much content I put in it. It will keep taking. I just set its minimum height. And same goes for min width also. I can say that keep the minimum width. Maximum space. Give it the width. This way we can do. I hope you are enjoying. I will reduce the text. I think I have done a little more. I can do it by saying 999. I can do it by saying 999. I can do it by saying 999. I can demonstrate it to you. And in fact if I want to do more. I can do more. I will leave it like this. I will do lorem 999. You can expand it. If you see lorem 999. You can expand it. To see that. This container. Will adjust its height. Will adjust its height. I will put a comment here. You can see here. As much text you see. You will see that its height. Is increasing. And it is adjusting. I hope you understood. About sizing. I have also shown you the exhaustive list. Exhaustive list of units. I will tell you one more thing. Before going. Percentage units are very important. Percentage units means. If you have a particular box. Width 50%. It means parent's 50% of the width. It means parent's 50% of the width. If I give paragraph width 50%. If I give paragraph width 50%. If I give paragraph width 50%. It means. It means parent's width 50%. It means parent's width 50%. It means parent's width 50%. It means parent's width 50%. It means parent's width 50%. The percent property. Is not applicable everywhere. You have to keep this in mind. A common mistake people do. Where the height is not set. In that container. People put height 100% or 80%. But the height of the parent is not set. So they have a problem. So always use VH and VW units. You can use the percentage. It means the width of the parent is set. And you want to give. Half or 25% of the width. For example in this case. I am giving width 50%. I will put a border. Border 2 pixels solid red. And you see. It has taken 50%. Of the parent. If I put something inside. For example I put a span. And I will say. In the container. Border 2 pixels. Solid blue. And width 50%. So it will be 50% of the width. If I put a span in a paragraph. I will show you. If I put a span. And I write lorem 23. So you see. I put a span here. In fact I didn't have to put span. I had to put div. I had to put a div in it. Why am I putting div in it. Because span is an inline element. So it will be a little difficult. So if I say here. There is a div inside p. So I styled it like this. And the problem here is. I had to write it like this. I will write it like this. Why will I write like this. Because I want to write it on the immediate child. Now see here. I wrote border 2 pixels solid blue. Actually the thing is. We can't put div in paragraphs. So I will put div. And inside it. I will make it div. And let's make it div. And now you see here. What I want to say. You will see. This is 50% of its parent. And this is also 50% of its parent. What is the parent of this blue box. Red box. And what is the parent of the red box. This black border box. I hope things are clear. You also have to see a little bit about the rest of the units. And I am telling you. As much as I have told you in this video. It's all that you need to know. And everything else. There are so many things here. There is EX, CAP, CH. Very less. I will say that 1-2% of the websites are used. So you are safe. And as you increase your CSS skills. To know about all these things.
