    "text": " In CSS, there is a very important property called Position. Suppose you want to move an element from its previous position, then you can use position relative to create a top 3 pixel and that 3 pixel will come down. Similarly, by using position property and z-index, you can keep the elements on top of each other. How all these things are done in CSS? In this video, we are going to understand. Do write Sigma Batch OPi in the comment section below. And keep this high energy. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. In CSS, position property is very important. So I will make a folder named video28 and show you. Let's name it video28. And after that you will know how important position property is and what can be done with it. So as always, I will make a boilerplate template here. And after making a boilerplate template, I will simply write CSS position here. I will put style tag here so that I can do styling of the elements. And I will put 3 boxes here. I will put 4. Box1, I gave one class, I will give one box2 class, I will give one box3 class, I will give one box4 class. And I will give one box class to all of them. So that if I want to do something with all the boxes, I can do it by dot box. So here I will simply say by dot box, make a border, border 2px solid black. And I always reset CSS by putting margin 0, padding 0 on universal selector. You must know this, if you know me a little bit. This is always my behavior that I select universal selector and put margin 0, padding 0. So if I see this, I didn't see it. And the reason for this, I would like to know what can happen. The reason for this is that we have not given height and width to each box. So let's give it height and width. Let's give it a height of 133 pixels. And let's give it a width. And I am going to give it a width of 80bw. Now that we know how our sizing units work. Along with that, I would like to give padding to all the boxes. And I will give padding 3 pixels from all sides. And I will also give margin 3 pixels from all sides. So what will happen with this, the boxes will look something like this. Now I will be able to target box 1, box 2, box 3, box 4 individually. But let's do one thing, first of all, I will make you access a playlist. Or click and ask for a book or click and save, which you will do right now. And along with that, I want you to open it in the browser. So as you saw here, our browser has prepared all our boxes by doing margin, padding and everything. If you want, you can also write box 1, box 2 here. But I think that's fine, okay. Let's leave it like this for now. Now what I will do is, I will write dot box 1 here. And I will add some CSS in it. And I will say this work for box 2, box 3, box 4. Okay. The background color in box 1, I will put it in the letter. Similarly, we will put a background color in box 2, any random. And the background color of box 3, background color, we put this in the letter. And I make the background color of this purple. Okay. So you saw here, we got 4 boxes in this way. Now what happens by default is that the position of all the boxes is static. Position is a property in CSS, which is by default static. And the meaning of static position is that top, bottom, left, right, z-index cannot be written on it. Now you will say what is top, bottom, left, right? Now suppose I put top 2 pixels on it, okay. So Chrome is telling me, brother, look. Position static property prevents top from having an effect. If you keep any position other than static, then you can enjoy this property. So how to enjoy this property, this is what I want to tell you now. So see, if I don't use position property in it, that is, its by default position should be static, then what will be the behavior? First of all, the top box will come, then this box will come after this, then this box will come after this, this is the bottom box, and then the last box will come after this. Typical CSS behavior that I will expect. Let us say that I put the absolute position of the bottom box inside it, okay. So you understood the meaning of static position, the meaning of static position is that it will remain where it was, no effect will be there, okay. Now after this, there is an absolute position, there is a relative, before absolute, I will tell you relative. What is relative positioning? Now suppose I say that box 2, I will say, put its position, relative, okay, what should I do? Relative, relative does not mean relative here, relative means that it moved from its place, now I can put top-bottom properties in it. If I say top 3 pixel, the more I increase, the more it will go down, it will keep moving, you see, it came above it, the more I increase, it will keep moving, the rest of the elements will not matter, I can move this element from its place. So if I want it to go up a little, and suppose I want it to go a little to the left, I say left 34 pixel, so the distance from left to here will be 34 pixels, and I will increase it as much as I want, I will keep increasing it, so what happened is that it got stacked up on our box, okay, our CN box, okay, it got stacked up on it, its color is not CN, I guess its color is Aqua, okay, so it came on the box of Aqua, now suppose for some reason you want, my box of Aqua should not be down, my box of Aqua should come up, this box should come behind it, so we can set the value of Z index, if I set the value of Z index here, let us say, if I do anything, it will not make any difference, okay, so what I have to do is, I have to put position relative here, then Z index will work, I will come to this later, why did we put position relative here, but as soon as I give it position relative here, I can set its Z index, if I give it 1, it should not be 0, it should be 1, if it has more than this Z index, then it will come up, now we have put position relative here, because whenever you want to use Z index, then you have to remove the static and give some position to the position property, okay, this is the rule to set Z index, here we have not used top bottom, so there will be no difference by putting position relative, its position will be set, and its position is set, means there is another position after removing static, because of that I can put Z index on it, if I remove Z index, then it will go back, so the static position is by default property, you know this, will you ever see position static in your CSS, yes, sometimes we use it, suppose I want to reset its position, I want it to be relative, then reset it, whenever a media query comes, means whenever we resize, I will tell you in the upcoming videos, but just I want to tell you that we sometimes write JavaScript and set position static, but forgetting all those things, we come to the point, we saw position static, we saw position relative, you can use top bottom left right, if you have put position relative, so if I reload it, then nothing will happen, because all these CSS, we were writing here, which goes after refreshing, so here I will quickly write, top 34 pixels, and bottom let us say 56 pixels, okay, and you see, from top and in fact not bottom, I have to write left here, left or right, either I will set top or bottom, I will do one of these two, so here you see, top 34 pixels, left 56 pixels, you see I have given from top, or I have given from left, okay, so I hope you understand this thing, if I want to set the z-index of other boxes, then I have to put position in it, but now I let it stay like this, so it came on top of it, you can see the box, so this was the position, now I want to tell you, what happens by doing position absolute, so what I will do, that first of all, I will give a parent to all our four boxes, that is, all these will come inside a parent div, so here I have given a class is equal to parent, and gave a parent div, let us say in this parent div, I want to write some styles, if dot parent, and I want to give some padding in it, let us say 3 pixels, and I want to give margin, let us say 34 pixels, and I make it 43 pixels, and here I give border, 2 pixels solid purple, okay, let us keep this much for now, and you can see, that there is a parent box, in which all these, which are our remaining boxes, they are kept, okay, so now what I will do, that I will give position to it, which is our box 1, I will give it position absolute, okay, what will happen by giving position absolute, by giving position absolute, it will seem like, that this element, see, I gave it position absolute, as soon as, it became like, that this element, it is not in normal document flow, okay, so see, this was my box 2, to which I gave position relative, and I gave it position relative, I want to end its position relative for once, just to explain to you, what is position absolute, so now you understand this, that when I will give position absolute, then what will happen, when I give it position absolute, then what will it do, I gave it position absolute, then it will not do anything, okay, but as soon as I said, position absolute top 0 pixels, you see, now what it will do, it went to the top in viewport, you can see, that what it will do, that it will find its parent, and will say, parent, are you a position element, understand this carefully, what I said, what I did, listen to me carefully, forget everything, whatever you were thinking, now look carefully at the screen, okay, div, which is box 1, in that I gave position absolute, as soon as absolute position is applied, and top 0 pixels are applied, now it will try to find, I want to be 0 pixel relative, so what will it do, it will find its parent, it will ask its parent, dad, are you a position element, its dad will say, wait, I will see, it will see, there is no position in my class, my position is static, so it will say, dad, bye, then it will say, dad, who is its dad, body, it will say, dad, are you a position element, it will say no, then it will go to its dad, it will say, but dad, are you a position element, it will say, I am not a position element, but there is no one above me, so you can be my relative, it will say okay, so its relative will be 0 pixels from top, so whose relative is it, nearest, positioned, ancestor, nearest, positioned, ancestor, okay, so what does position mean, position is not static, it is something else, now you see here, if you don't understand what its parent is, then listen again, here I have made position absolute, made top 0 pixels, if I increase the top, then it comes like this, if I make left 0, add one more here, and I say, left should also be 0, so here left is the relative of html, it is 0, okay, so here you can see, left is 0, now, what will I do, if I increase the left, if I increase it like this, so you can see here, that it is going here, because the distance of 144 pixels, this will be done, and top 8 pixels means, it is 8 pixels from here, okay, so top 8 pixels, left 144 pixels, okay, I hope you understood what I am saying, that when I made position absolute, so I will make 8 pixels from top, so it has decided, it will move relative of html, so top 8 pixels, relative of html, and here 144 pixels, relative of html here, but what would have happened, what would have happened, if I would have made position of its parent, that means, its parent, the dot parent class, let me document the format, the dot parent class, if I put position in that, let us say I put absolute, now I have not set its top and bottom, so parent will not move from anywhere, okay, you have to keep this in mind, but its position is absolute, that means, parent's position is set, that's all the change has come, now when it will ask, papa, papa, are you positioned, so its papa will say, yes, I am positioned, so my relative is also set, so now the box 1, so now the box 1, that top 0 pixels, will be relative of whose, relative of its parent, see, top 0 pixels, relative of its parent, that means, if I will increase it, then relative of its parent will work, relative of html will not work, you have seen this thing, and if I put left here, in this way, that left becomes 3 pixels, so you can see here, that by doing left 3 pixels, and if I increase left 3 pixels, so you can see here, that this is how, relative of its parent is working, so the position is absolute, what it does, it finds its nearest parent, which is positioned, and once it finds, its nearest positioned element, relative of that, that top left, or bottom right, bottom left, whatever set it is, according to that, it puts its position, I hope, that everyone understood this thing, write in the comment, I understood this thing, now we have another property, fixed, I will do one thing, I will reset it again, and as we had 4 boxes, they will come as they are, the position I have given in parent, I will remove that too, and you can see here, that all our 4 boxes, they came as they were, now if you will agree, that I will fix the position, let us say, of this third box, that is, of box 3, I say the position, that I want to fix, so if I write here, position, and I write fixed, so you can see, position fixed, and top, let us say, or I will do bottom, bottom 0 pixels, and left, I will do, let us say, 25 bw, okay, if I do something like this, so what will happen, see here, 25 bw shifted, now I want to show you one thing, and you know what is that thing, that thing is, that it will be fixed here, no matter, if I scroll this page too, now there is not much content on this page, that I can scroll it, but I can always fix that, by increasing the height of the box, so where the height was 133, there I will increase it to 433, for height boxes, so you can see, that now I am scrolling it too, so the box is set here, can you see, so I will do anything, if I want to keep something like this, you must have seen many sites, where if you scroll once, then the ad or something else, will be static, now I will fix it, I will bring it to the center, box 3, so the 25 bw, that I had given here, 25 bw, I will reduce it, to bring it to the center, I will do something like this, okay, and I will do left 8 bw, and here too I will do 8 bw, where did you go left box 3, here is 8 bw, as soon as I do 8 bw, you can see here, and if I refresh it, then it will be here, irrespective of how my other website, is scrolling, and if I want to set its height too, if I do 111 pixels, from its height, so you can see here, that I will have to do something important, because the box I have written, below, so I will do one thing, I will put the definition, above, I will put its definition above, something like this, and now see, its height has changed, you can see here, that my box, on which I have put position fix, that is fixed, so box 3 is fixed, okay, and it is fixed according to this, and I am scrolling the page too, so nothing is happening, okay, I hope you understood, now I will tell you, about position sticky, and for this, I would like to take a better example, okay, so I will show you one thing here, that the position I had put, here in box 3, I will comment this out, and I will make box 1 sticky, and I will say, that its position is sticky, okay, as soon as I will make its position sticky, you can see here, I will make top 0, I will have to make top 0 too, I have made top 0 pixels, I will say, that 0 pixels from top, as soon as I will do this, you can see, it is stuck, okay, and when does this come in use, I will tell you, suppose, that our box is a newspaper, okay, and its height, let us say, is 111 pixels, and its width, suppose, its width is, let us say, 100%, and its margin 0, and padding 0, I would like to make padding 0 too, and you will see, margin 0, padding 0, this is how it is, it is in our parent obviously, but as soon as I scroll it, see, everything is scrolling above it, so suppose, this is my navbar of this website, I know, this is not a very good navbar, and we are going to make a better website than this, and this is just a start, I will tell you, many people were saying in the comments, that when will we make good websites, let us finish all the properties, then we will make, this is the website that you will also say, that this will go a little higher, we have raised it a little higher, and this is the target, that I will teach you how to make dangerous websites, but I want to tell you some basics here first, you see here, this box, we have given a position, sticky, sticky means, something that sticks, the thing that sticks, it will stick on the wall, you see, as soon as I scroll, it sticks, okay, and if I come here, it will stay like this, until you scroll to this, it will not stick, so until you scroll to this, it will behave like a static position, but as soon as you scroll beyond it, as soon as you scroll beyond it, you can see here, position, by doing sticky here, it sticks up, okay, so this is position sticky, there is a lot of difference between fixed and sticky, I don't know why people say that, that we have confusion in fixed and sticky, according to me, fixed is different, sticky is different, this is a very frequently asked question, if you go to stackoverflow, you will see that I am confused between fixed and sticky, but I don't think that there is a lot of confusion in fixed and sticky, or something, fixed means, the name is also telling, fix it at one place, that means you have taken 4 pages, and pasted the box here, on your screen, it will not move from here, it is pasted here, okay, fix means, fix it on the wall, by screwing, remember it like this, and sticky means, that until you scroll above it, it will remain static, and as soon as you scroll above it, it will stick to the wall like this, as you can see, this is our sticky, okay, now the position we have given is sticky, I hope you understood all 4 properties well, now I want to make a comment about position absolute, and before making that comment, I will remove the position sticky and top, and after removing all this, I will revert it to position absolute, so when you will see box 1, then its position is absolute, and this is relative to our HTML, and as I told you, that box 1 will check its parent first, if the position is on it, then it will be relative to its parent, as you can see, above HTML, here relative to body will not be set, it will be set here, okay, now if I fix its position, then also its position will be assumed to be on, and you see here, this is its relative set, if I make its position sticky, means if I stick the parent's position, and its position is absolute, so the child will position himself relative to its parent, like we can see in case of box 1, in box 1 we have given top 0 left 3, so top 0 left 3 will be relative to the parent, as the parent is positioned, now whether it is positioned by position fix, whether it is positioned by position sticky, whether it is positioned by position absolute, or if it is positioned by position relative, then it will work as relative of parent but there is one exception in this and it can introduce some weird bugs in your code if you don't know transform, filter or perspective properties can also make an element appear as positioned ok if I set perspective property on transform, filter then it will also assume that it is positioned what does it mean and what is this weird thing suppose I didn't position it suppose I didn't put position relative it's child has absolute position listen carefully if you don't pay attention then you won't understand I guarantee you before you say that you don't understand because these things are very audible watch the video again if you want here I said that I have not used any kind of positioning in this so it will set itself relative of body or you can say relative of HTML it's the same thing so it will assume that it is relative of body it will go on top of the document according to that it will follow top 0 and left 3 pixels but if I put position relative here then what will happen then it will be relative of parent but there is one more exception when it will be relative of parent if I put transform property on it about which I have not told you I know that I have not told you about transform property so what I will do I will make it translate 0 I will make it translate 0 I will tell you about translate and transform properties in the coming videos but for now you assume that it is a property if this property is there then also see what happened it is relative of parent so here these three properties are the exception which very few people tell and I have not seen this thing anywhere I have felt it myself there was a bug in my code after that I saw here and there I did not get the answer of stack overflow I got it in the comment I got to know about it I am telling you a long time ago and if filter property is also there like filter property is there filter and invert assume I put invert filter and you see here by doing filter invert basically color is inverted but by putting filter invert it also made itself and if I make invert 0 then I guess nothing happens so here you see as I made filter invert 0 so this box is relative of parent but if we do not know this thing that these three properties can make it look like a position element then we might get cheated and interviewers also ask this thing that we will put filter invert on your parent or any kind of filter and will ask you that tell me this box will make itself relative of whom? top most relative of HTML or relative of this parent and if you do not know this thing then it is possible that it will make itself relative of HTML because it does not have position but if filter is there then also it will make itself relative of this parent I hope it is clear you are understanding this thing same goes for perspective property also if I set perspective property here so for now I have made perspective 0m and you see here this is relative of parent which means these three properties can also make it look like a position element I hope that makes sense for now I will remove this but these three properties you have to keep in mind I will put it up and here is an exception I will write it as an exception it is a very important exception and with this our position property ends I hope you guys enjoyed and you guys also said that it is fun after listening to all these properties because by using position and z-index you can make your element appear anywhere if you want that one particular element comes above all then increase its z-index if you want that one particular element is below one and above someone else then you guys set the values of z-index accordingly that the one who has the most value in z-index will come above all and the one who has the least will be below all so in this way you play around with z-index and I hope you guys enjoyed in this course if you guys have not accessed it yet then do the playlist and I am updating source code daily to daily and here by setting it as 0 it looks so beautiful do you guys agree tell me in the comment section below for now that's it in this video guys access the playlist and like the video you must have subscribed to the channel you must have accessed the github code and if I have not named my uncle's land then send it in his papers thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time"
