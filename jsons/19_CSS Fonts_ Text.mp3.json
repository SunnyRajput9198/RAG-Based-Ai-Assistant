    "text": " In today's video, we will see how fonts and color CSS work. In this video, I will also tell you how you can use external fonts on your website. We will know how font sizes can be changed, what is the concept of fallback font. And I will tell you all this with examples. Let's go to the video stream. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I will say again that today's video is going to be a very important video. Because in this, I will tell you a few fonts and colors. And any website you make in your life, fonts and colors will definitely be seen there. So what I will do as usual, I will click on shift right here and make a new folder. In which I will make a folder named video 19. I will open it by clicking on shift right. And as soon as I open it, you can see here that I have made a file named index.html. And I am going to write internal CSS here. Because I don't want to make a style sheet. So that everything of you is on the same page. So first of all, I will make a div here. And I will write h1 in this div. And I will write fonts in h1. And I will put a paragraph in it. This is a video on fonts. Now I want to tell you that if you have not accessed this playlist yet, then click here and bookmark it. Because you can do it by clicking here. Or click here and save it. And along with that, the source code is being updated. You can see this too. I have updated the source code of all the videos. So I do the source code update from time to time. If I preview it and show it to you, then no surprises. Here it is written that this is a video on fonts. But the interesting thing is that you can change the font. Now many people will be beginners here. And they don't know what font is. This is a different font. And this is a different font. And this is a different font. That is, if you see the text appearing different, then it appears different because of the font. So if we want to change the font of any element, then we use font family. So I can easily put a style tag here. That paragraph, make its font family. What should I do? Now see, there are many options here that automatically gives me VS Code. Suppose I want to see COUI, Tahoma, and so many fonts here. These are comma separated values. Which will try to put the first font here. If this font is not available in your system, then it will try to put this font. And so on. So these are called fallback fonts. That is, the main font is COUI. And Tahoma, Geneva, Wardana, San Serif, these are fallback fonts. Okay, so you see here, as soon as I show you here, then its font has changed a little. If I want to change the font family of my H1. Now suppose I want Times New Roman to come here. So I will put Times New Roman in the font family. And I think it is by default Times New Roman. So there is no difference here. But let's try something else. And here as soon as I write font family, I will write like this. So let's do Lucid Ascense and this one which is a whole set of font family. So see here that I have changed the font. This font looks a little better now. Compared to, if I say, the font that was here before. So you can change the font from font family. Now whenever we put font family, it is said that whenever you are putting font family, then at least put one such generic font family. So that if the user's computer does not have that font, then there is no problem. In this case, it is suggested that like Times New Roman, like CIOUI, like Sans Serif, it is necessary to put a font family in your fonts whenever you are making websites. So this way you can give fonts here. Now we have a lot of other properties related to fonts. Like if I want in Paragraph that I want to make the font style italic. So I can make bold italic. I have made font style italic here. So I can do it like this. In font style, we have one italic and one is normal and one is oblique. There is no bold. For bold, we have to use font weight. So if I make it oblique here, then it will look like this. And along with that, if I can't even underline it. Actually, I will have to use text decoration for underline. So these values are here. Now here it is usually used for italic. So if you want to do italic, then you will use font style. As soon as you write font here, see a lot of properties related to fonts have come. And I want to tell you about font weight here. These are all values, bold, bolder, lighter. And you can also put values like this. So see it has become a little thick, that is, it has become bold. So whenever you want to make bold, then you can use it and make bold. So you can do oblique, you can do italic from font style, you can do normal. And if you want to underline here, then you can use text decoration. So text decoration is a property by which you can underline. So I want to tell you this. And you can also overline. So the way you see the overline, the line comes up. But all these properties, I am telling you honestly, they are not that useful. The more italic you get, the more font weight you will get. So here is a code pen, I put the link of which here. Before I forget, I put the link of the code pen here. And this code pen link will tell you which font families look like. So see here, Serif looks like this, Sans Serif looks like this, Monospace will look like this, and cursive will look like this. And you can see here that this code pen is showing a lot of things that how your families look like. Okay. Now what happens is that usually when you do web development, then you will want that you use some special fonts. Like I use Ballu Bhai. Ballu Bhai is a font that I like very much. Yes, Ballu Bhai and Ballu Behna, these two are the names of fonts, I will show you now. And in this way, you use Google Fonts. So I will show you how to use Google Fonts. So if you see here, I will write Google Fonts in the new tab. And as soon as I come to Google Fonts, I can actually use a font. If I write Ballu Bhai here, Ballu Bhai, I hope I am spelling it correct. Ballu Bhai, there is also Ballu Da, there is also Ballu Behna. And here I am not getting Ballu Bhai font, why is this Arabic font showing me? I will come here to Home, and I will write here, Hey, I am good. And here you see, Ballu Bhai, Ballu Behna, Ballu Bhai 2, I am getting all these fonts. Okay, now if I click here, then you see here, Ballu Bhai 2 will look something like this in English. Now suppose I want to use this font, I reset it. If I want to use it, then what I will simply do is I will click here. Okay, suppose I don't want medium 500, I want my font to look like this. Or I want it to look normal. So I will click on plus here, and it will give me a font here. Now there are two ways to include font, either you do it through link or through import. If you are doing it through import, then you put it in style tag, import statement, which I will show you now. And I hope I am not going fast, I am just trying that I am not repetitive. And I can take your time and teach you as much as possible. So here you can see, I did import URL like this. Now if I want here, I will comment this out. And I will write here, font family, and in fact what I will do, I will copy from here. Because here font family is given, and you have to apply it like this. So it becomes a little convenient to copy and paste. And here see, Ballu Bhai has given sans serif, that by chance you don't have Ballu Bhai 2 font, so you got sans serif. Now you can see here, this font looks exactly like this. It was written as Hey I am good. And I will remove italic from it. And I will also remove font weight. Because I just told you these two things to teach you. You want your font to look exactly like you have downloaded. And I can see it exactly like that, because I have downloaded this Ballu Bhai 2 from here. So you can see here, that I have got this font. Now if I want to use Ling, then I will actually copy this Ling, then I will remove this import one from here. And now I will put it in my head tag. I will do a right click format document, so that unnecessary spaces go away. And you can see here, that I have included this font through Ling, in my web page. So I can include fonts through HTML in my web page. And if I want, I can include font through style tag. Like you have seen here, that my Ballu Bhai is intact. My Ballu Bhai font is visible here, which is a good thing. You can include many fonts like Poppins, which I use a lot. To be honest, Poppins is one of my favorite fonts. So if I want to include Poppins, then it's always recommended that you include all the fonts you want in one go. Like I want this Poppins, I have included this. So I will include these Ling and Imports in one go. So it's always recommended that you, I will remove Ling tags, because I am using Imports. So you can see here, that Ballu Bhai is also coming through one Import statement. And Poppins font is also coming through one Import statement. So you can do 1 arrow, 2 arrows, or even 50 arrows. But I don't think you will need 50 fonts in one web page. Now if I want my heading to be Poppins, then what I will do is, I will make Poppins font here. And since Poppins is available, then what will happen is, Poppins will be added. So you can see here, that I use Poppins font a lot. It's one of my favorite fonts. But you can go to Google Fonts and explore a lot of fonts. I can guarantee you that you will enjoy. So this was about fonts in CSS. And I want to tell you about some other properties of fonts. The first property is font size. You can change font size. If I talk about font size, then I can use large, medium, xsmall, double xlarge. But I will recommend you pixel units. Then we will talk about other units. If I make it 20 pixels, then you can see that font will be a little bigger. Now I want to show you one thing. If I don't put any font size here, means I haven't put any font size, then by default one size will be of H1, one size will be of paragraph. And this styling will be of default browser. Let me hide my face. Now you can see H1 here. I will select this, go to computed, and see here font size 32 pixels. So I will reset it here. Just in case, any value is not bad through zoom. If I write font size here, then see 32 pixels is of H1. And its default font size is 16 pixels. You can see here, 16 pixels is the default font size. If I want my font size to be bigger, 20 pixels, then I will make it 20 pixels. And now you can see here, 20 pixels font size is here. This is a video on fonts. Now you can select here and increase font size through arrow keys. I am using up arrow key to increase font size. And I can use down arrow key to make my font smaller. So here you can see, I can make my font smaller. I am using up arrow key to increase font size. And I am using down arrow key to decrease font size. So you can adjust CSS like this. For example, I want to make it 49 pixels. And I want to make font weight 900 pixels. No, 900 is little more. Let's make it 700. Yes, 600 is fine. Let's say I want to set its color, let's say red. If I like these styles, then I will copy them. Like this. Now if I reload it, then all these styles will be gone. Because all the styles you put from here are temporary. But if you want to put these styles permanently, then whatever element you put, like I put it on paragraph, I can paste these styles here. And they are forever here. I will reload it, and they are here. Because I have pasted it in my code. But for now I will not use these styles. So I hope you understood how font size works. Now after this there is a concept of line height. And let's say I make line height 4. I made line height 4. And for that I have to put some content in paragraph. Let's say I write another paragraph. And I write lorem 45 here. And why I wrote lorem 45, you will tell me in the comment section. Why I wrote 45, or why I write 23. So you see what will happen with line height here. Space will come here. And here space is here. Because here line height is 4. Now if I reduce it, as I reduce it, let's say I make it 1.4 or 1.8. So you understood that this spacing is line height. It controls basically. If you want to increase the space of your lines, increase the line height. If I want to know what will be the default value of line height, then I will remove line height from here. And I will go to computed and search line height. Line height. Now here I am not able to see line height in this element. So in this element, I guess no line height is computed. So I will search on google default line height. So the default line height is about 110 to 120 percent. So if you want to change the line height, then you do more than 1.2 if you want to do more. Or you reduce it from 1.2. And line height will help you to increase the spacing of this. After this, there is one more property letter spacing. And I am telling you that it is not used much. And if I increase the letter spacing, then see what is happening here. It increases the spacing of letters. So if you want to increase the letter spacing, then you can use it. I personally don't use it much. But these are all things that you should know. Through this video, I want you to know all those things that you may want to do. If you want to capitalize the letter first, then you should know how to do it. Because some things you may not know how to do it. Then it will be a lot of trouble. So I show you here that if you want to capitalize any first letter or any word like H1. Or I do one thing, I put H2 here. Okay. And I write about fonts here. Now I will write H2 here. I hope you can see. I will zoom in a little. If I write H2 here, text transform. And let's say I write capitalized here. So if I have made the F of about fonts one of the about fonts small, then you see here that the A of about fonts will be capitalized. Now if I write in text transform with letters by putting colon lowercase, then you see here that it will be a whole lowercase. If I do uppercase, it will be uppercase. And it comes into work. It is not that it will never come into work. Everything should not be said that it will not come into work. It is actually going to come into your work. So this property, I hope that you guys tie it in your tool belt. Then it happens here, I told you about text decoration that if you want to underline then underline text decoration, it will be underlined. But I tell you about text decoration color. Text decoration color. So here you can see text decoration color if you do aqua, then see here it is underlined with aqua color. So you can also change text decoration color. And this is very helpful when you make navigation bars and so on. And in navigation bars it happens that when you hover over them then their color changes or the line appears in this way. So all those things you can do through CSS. So I hope you guys are understanding things. Write in the comment section, whatever you understand. Then very quickly I tell you about two properties. Text decoration style. Like let's say I add text decoration style to this element. And I add it here so that you guys have code for reference. Text decoration style. And here if I want dotted style. If dotted is here, then it will be dotted. So see it is dotted. If you can't see it, then I hope you can see it now. So if I want it dotted, then my underlining will be dotted. There are many other values like see here it is dotted, double, inherit. Inherit means it will inherit from its parent. If I do solid, it will be like this. If I do wavy, it will be like this. If you want dash or dotted, then you can do it. See, dash is like this, dotted is like this. Then wavy is like this. But I will tell you from my personal experience, I have done so much web development in my life. Maybe sometime these wavy dotted lines of yours will be useful. But see, you should know. I will say again, you should know. All these things are like this. If you don't know, then it will be a problem. If someone tells you that I want dash or dotted, then you should know how to make it. So these are some properties that you should know. There is thickness also. I will tell you thickness also. And there are many other things. But if you want to do thickness, then you will write text deco, then it will suggest thickness. If you don't want to type text decoration color or don't want to type any property, then what you do, write T, D and C. I will show you. Like if I don't want to type this and I want to be suggested quickly, then I will write T, D, E and T, H. Okay, I will show you. I will show you. Means this, this little, this little and this little and it will be suggested. Means I want text decoration thickness. See, this is important. Your productivity will increase. Text decoration D, E and thickness from T, H. See, it came. And it is showing why it is being suggested. Because you took T, E from here, D, E from here, T, H from here. If you hit enter, it will come straight. And then after this, you simply use arrow key. Here what you have to do, if you just colon like this, then see, it is showing you. Now what do you want? If you want thickness, then you can adjust the value of thickness. Okay, let's say I do this, 45 pixels. I hope I didn't do too much. I guess I have done too much. So I will remove it by not doing dotted. I will keep it solid. I will keep it solid. And you will see here that I have made it too thick. See, I have to reduce its value a little. See, I will reduce its value. So it is a little less. I think 7 pixels is more than enough. 7 pixels is way more than enough. So let's do 7 pixels. And see, it has become thick. So sometimes you have to make it thick. What do you have to make it thick? If you want to make your underline, text decoration thicker, then you can do something like this. So you guys use text decoration thickness to make it thicker. After this, I would also like to tell you about text indent property. The text indent property, let's say I do 45 pixels. Text indent. So see, an indent comes from here. So you can add indent. And I would like to show you here that my H2, if I reduce the value of text indent, I am doing it with arrow key. So see, you can indent it like this. After this, text overflow is going to be used a lot to make vlogs. Text overflow property means what you want. If your text is overflowing from your box, then what should it be? Like, let's say this is here. I comment out some properties here. Like I don't want dotted. I make it black. I don't want to do aqua. I make text decoration color blue. Because black I guess is by default. Now I want to set the width of my text overflow. Let's say I set the width to 45 pixels. And as soon as I did 45 pixels, it became like this. Now if I do ellipsis in text overflow or let's say I do clip. So what will happen? What is the difference between ellipsis and clip? I will tell you. If I increase the width of this, it will become like this. Let's do the same for paragraph. I think we can understand this thing better in paragraph. So I will give a class here. And in class I will do lorem. I will put a style here. dot lorem. And I will do the same thing here. First text overflow, then I will give its width. First of all, I will give border 2 pixels solid red. And after this, I will give its width 45 pixels. And let's see how it looks. So it looks like this. Now what I will say here in paragraph that if there is text overflow in this, then do ellipsis. Now one more important thing here is that you have to hide the overflow. Which means if it is overflowing from the box, what do you want your element? You want scroll, you want hidden. So you see I have hidden the overflow. So this is happening with ellipsis. And if I clip it, I will show you its value by changing it to clip. So here it is completely clipped. So there are other properties like this. I would like to tell you one more property like this and that is word break. So I will do one thing, I will make it 145. I will do both of them like this. And here I will write word break. So if I do break all in word break, then you see here that if I don't do break all here, then what is happening? So see here the dollar went down. If I do break all then what will happen? Here it will break the word. It did DOL and did OR here. So if you want your words to break, then you can use this property. Word break break all. Then after this there is a text line property. Let's say I want to center it. So I will put text line center here. Text line center. And now see it has become center. If I reload it, then it will go for sure. So I will put it in the h2. And I will say text line center. So here it is automatically suggesting me and I am taking it as my property. Which is very important for me. If I am coding, then you see here about font center is done. I hope you understood this thing. So these were all the text properties. Now here the text properties are very important. Because if you want to make good websites, then you should know everything about text. Only then you will be able to control your text. So these were the text properties. I will give you a link in the description where you will get to learn additionally about all these things. And after all this I have read in this video, things will be very intuitive for you. So what I will do is now I will move towards colors. And I will tell you how colors work. So let's do one thing. Let's make one more html file with the name of colors.html. Because I have spread a lot of mess there while understanding fonts. Because obviously this is not a good website. I have made this to teach you concepts. And we will make good websites. Wait. So let's talk about colors. So here I will put its heading colors. And I will put a little heading of this too. Fonts. I know it doesn't look good. So I can give it a little beauty by putting a title. Now after this I will put style here. Oops, I don't know why I put capital for style. And what I will do here I will write h1. Let's learn. Learn about colors. Now suppose I want to change the color of h1. So I will say h1. I have used the element selector here. I will do the format document. I will use the element selector and make the color red. Color and red. And obviously you guessed it right. The color here I want to preview colors.html. Yes it's done. Let's learn about colors. You can see here that the color is red. No surprises there. Now can I make it orange? Yes I can. Orange. And you can see here that it's color is orange. What are the color keywords that can be used. Now see these are color keywords. It's possible that the color that is in your mind is not a color keyword in CSS. It happens. And I am stuck. I am personally telling you. I am so stuck in these things that I don't know what color is going on in my mind. Like light blue is going on. I have written light blue here. So I will show you how to find out. Now see if I write dark yellow. I have written dark yellow here. And you see it's not coming. How did I know that it's not dark yellow. Because if I show you here. So dark red is there? Yes dark red is there. Is it dark grey? Dark grey is there. Dark green is there. So why is dark yellow not there? What is this? So what happens is that in CSS there are some color keywords. And what I will do is I will show you a code pen. That code pen you don't have to write. I mean this is a very common sense thing that you don't have to write. But here you can see Alice blue, antique white, aqua, aquamarine, azure, blue and all these colors. The colors in CSS have a comprehensive list. So let's do one thing. I am putting you here just to see you. It's not like you have to write it. Don't think that I am sitting to remember it. No. I know you are smart and you won't do that. So these are the color keywords we have. So it's very easy for us. I will put a good color for it. Dark red. One is the easiest way for us. Here I close this too. I close this too. I close this too. I close this too. Here use the color keyword. But sometimes what happens? See colors are millions of colors. If someone has to give you a particular color, that means he gave you hex color code. Now what is hex color code? Hex color code is a way to represent code. Now I will tell you three ways that are very commonly used to show color. So I will do one thing. I will write a paragraph here. I will write color can be represented in. And here first of all I will make an ordered list. I will put a list item in the OL. And I will write here color codes. Sorry color keywords. And here hex color codes. One LI. One list item is mine. Hex color code. And after this I will put one more LI. RGB. Then I will put one more LI. RGBA. And then I will put one more LI. That is HSLU. Saturation and lightness. So here you see what is the first method. So if I have to do it through color keywords, then I have shown you how to do it. Now I will show you how you can use this color. By giving a hex color. If I write color here. I write hashtag here. And I FFAB. In fact, I will not choose a random color. I will go to hex color code. And here you see a lot of hex color codes of colors. You can give a hex color code of any color. And the way to generate a hex color code is shown here. And if you have to take this color. I mean I like this color. Wow, what a good color. Suppose this thing is sitting in my mind. So what I will do is I will copy this hex color code. And it will generate exactly the same color for me. So after the hash I will write this. And you see this green color here. So hex color is a way to represent color. Which uses hex values. Okay. Now a particular hex color will also have an RGB equivalent. If it is a very common color like red. So its color keyword will also be equivalent. So if you want to use any color. Then its code will be given to you. Now that code can be given to you in RGB. That code can be given to you through a color code color keyword. Like red, blue. Or you can be given that RGB, RGBA or HSL. So this is hex color code. Now I will tell you how RGB is used. If you want to use RGB. Then you will write color and RGB. And here the value of red is 0 to 255. Suppose I write 23. Green value is 0 to 255. And here the value of blue is 0 to 255. And see this color is made. Now if you hover over it. Then you will see this. And you can generate any color through this. See the RGB values are also changing below. So you can generate any color. So this RGB values means if red is this much. Green is this much. Blue is this much. Then this color is made. If you want to make it white. Then 255, 255, 255. If you put all colors. Then it will become white. If you want to make it black. Then don't put anything. 0, 0, 0. And different colors are made from the middle values. So RGB becomes a particular color. You can use it. This is one way to represent colors. Another way to represent colors is RGBA. And RGBA is same as RGB. RGBA is same as RGB. Only one thing is changed. That is alpha. And what is alpha value? It varies from 0 to 1. If I make it 0.5. I will show you. So I can make it from 0 to 1. You can see the value is changing. And by default it is 1. If I make it 1. Then there is no need to write. But you can see. If I make alpha this much. So what is alpha? Alpha is opacity. If I make opacity less. Then the color will look like this. It is light. After this, you have HSL equivalent of color. If I have to tell you what is the most used. Most of the time, these color keywords are used. After that, hex color is used most of the time. Because those people who make designs. They mostly use hex color codes in their designs. And when they use hex color codes. So developers like us have to use hex color codes to bring exact color in our design through HTML and CSS. Okay. So here we have to use the value we have got. If we have been told that RGB color is used. Okay. Give us the values. We will use it. If your boss has told you that RGB values are used through red color. Okay. We will use this. The exact same color will be made. You can make it anywhere. If any developer has used a particular color in Android app. If that developer has to use the same color in their website. Then they have to bring the exact color code. Either hex color code or values of RGB. Or values of RGBA. Sometimes HSL is also used. Let me tell you. It is used less. I personally do not use HSL in my websites. Okay. But HSL is used. Now I would like to tell you. HSL has H which represents type of color. S means how much intensity is there. It is purity. And L determines lightness. Now you see. HSL color can be made like this. I will copy the color from here. And I will show you. Personally I am not a big fan of HSL to be honest. But sometimes I am given colors. So I have to apply. So this color is made from this HSL. Okay. And you obviously hover here. If you change it. It will change in HSL. If I have to change. You can see here. You can also give alpha. So HSLA is also there. But again. It is not used much. You can also give alpha value. Something like this. Okay. I can also add HSLA. But again. We will keep alpha 100. And use HSLA for now. Because if you are making your website. You have full creative control over. Which color you are using. Okay. So this was about color. If you want to add color in background. We use the same thing in background color. And exactly the way I gave color. You can give it that way. For example. If you want to give background color. You can give HSLA. You can give RGBA. You can give color key words. You can give hex code. Sky is the limit. It is your choice. Here. Your choice. Okay. You will say. It is my choice. Whatever color I use. If you are making your website. If you are making someone else's. Then he will say. It is my choice. You are a developer. Make a website. Okay. Use the color. Now border color. And your text. Decoration color. So the color. Border color. And there are many other colors. Where we will read the colors. There we can use this kind of values. So that was about colors in CSS. Now there are many things. Like how to read HSLA. Exactly how to tweak these values. How to make a particular color. So that will go to design lessons. Things. You should have the goal. How to make a good website. So I hope in this long video. I have explained the fonts and colors. Because many people were saying. That the videos are getting short. So I thought to give a long video. So I have tried to explain the fonts and colors. I am enjoying telling in the comment section. In this course. And people are not bookmarking the playlist. And not liking the video. Which is very wrong. According to me. You should access this playlist. Click here and bookmark. Click here and save. And prepare to meet me in the next video. By naming your village and your uncle's land. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Thank you."
