    "text": " I told you about Flexbox, you understood it very well. Now it's time to check your Flexbox skills. For which I have prepared an exercise for you. Which will be based on Flexbox. If you can do this exercise, then you have understood the concept of Flexbox. And you are ready to use Flexbox in your web development projects. Don't forget to like the video. And write Sigma Patches in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's do the intro. Intro So guys, the website that we are going to make in this exercise. It will be very similar to a real world website. That is, we are going to do such a thing in this exercise. That you have to design a navbar. A website that I will give you. Using Flexbox. You cannot use anything else without Flexbox. So I will give you a link in the description. You have to go to this website and design its navbar. Now you don't have to make this hover functionality. You just have to make its navbar here. Recreate the navbar. You don't have to make the part below. Although if you make this part, then it's a very good thing. But again, the exercise part will not be there. You just have to make the navbar. Try it, the whole website below will be made. So this is a very simple website. Which I have chosen for you. This is an ultra edit website. Ultra edit is a text editor. It is a very heavy duty text editor. So you can download its free trial and try it out. It will be a very big editor. But in this exercise, I want you to design this navbar. I am giving you the link in the description. You have to design it and tell me. And it is simple according to me. Don't use the grid. Use Flexbox only. It is very straightforward. You can download these icons from anywhere. You can buy it from anywhere. Otherwise, if you make it without icons, then that should also be fine. But again, you will get icons. Otherwise, take a screenshot of this. You can take a screenshot of this with the snipping tool. But again, if you don't get these icons, then that should also be totally fine. I want everyone to solve this exercise quickly. And it is very easy according to me. There is nothing much big. I have already taught you Flexbox very well. And I am going to give you all the English subtitles and timestamps. So this course is becoming ultimate. And I want to tell you one more thing. The Sigma Web Developer course is a very dangerous course. And I am telling you this from the bottom of my heart. I have put so much effort in this. And the upcoming videos are also coming. You don't have to go anywhere else. I can tell you this with confidence. We are going to do everything here. And if you have not accessed this playlist yet, then do it. Click here and bookmark it. And click here and save it. That's all for this video. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Thank you so much."
