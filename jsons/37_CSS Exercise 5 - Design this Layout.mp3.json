    "text": " In today's video, I will give you an exercise in which you have to design a layout. You will have a lot of options to design that layout. But I want you to design this layout using all the things we have seen in this course. If you accept this challenge, then write Challenge Accepted in the comment section below. This will let me know that you are confident that you will be able to solve this question. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, today's exercise is very simple. First of all, I will tell you that you will not have any problem solving this. So everyone must solve this. And our exercise is something like this. Let's say this is your screen. Let's say this is my screen. I want you to make a nav bar that will be attached to your screen. So this will be your nav bar. Something like this. This will be your nav bar. Now what you have to do with this nav bar is to make it so thin. I am giving you a rough layout here. After this, you have to make a section that will look something like this. Let me tell you how it will look. This will be your section, one side will be here and one side will be here. So I will replicate this and show you. And here you see that it will look like this. Now you have to make it in a way that you can see how many pixels are there. Your website should look like this. When you use Figma design to make a website, then all these things are written there. This thing is so many pixels, this thing is so many pixels, this is so much RAM, this will look like this in the phone. But there is no restriction here. This is an exercise for you to solve. Make this layout. One is here, one is here and these two spaces are apart. Let's do one thing. Because it doesn't look good, let's make it this way. Let's make it like this. One box is here, one box is here and there will be a background in it. So I will cover it with one more box and send it backward. I will send it backward again. Now see this is a box whose background color you have to give here. You have to give different background colors for each box. If I want, I can also give background colors here. And I can also fill it with any given color. Let me do that, so that you also know how to do it. So here I will fill it with blue. And I am using draw.io, so it is not necessary that you know draw.io. Just see, don't worry about it. It is useful to make diagrams. I think it's a little good, I'll make diagrams with it. That's all you have to do. And one will come, your footer. Now there is not much here, this is a catch. I will tell you. One more thing I am going to tell you. It will make our exercise a little fun. You will also know how to make it fun. So what we have to do is, I am pulling it a little in length. And we have to make another rectangle here. And this rectangle will have a border radius. And something is going to come in this. Let's say we write something here about our services. And you will put a text here. What text will you put? I will tell you what text you have to put. So I will put text here, welcome. By the way, I pressed T to put text. Welcome to this Sigma Web Development Express. Now here is an element that is going to make this exercise very interesting. That is, see, first of all I will enlarge it a little. Just so that it looks good inside. So I want to make this exercise interesting. And how will I make it interesting? That the navigation bar you are getting to see. First I will change the color. I make a little good color in it. So the navigation bar you are seeing should be sticky. That is, when you scroll, it should have a round scroll. Okay, so you understand how you have to stick it up. And along with that, you have to put an icon here. And I will take a circle for it. You have to put an icon that will always be stuck here. Now I will not tell you the name, which position you have to use. That is your headache, not my headache. It was my headache to tell, I finished my headache. Now you have to see which position will be applied. So that it will hang down. That is, if I scroll, it should stay here. If I scroll, it is not that you make it sticky. It should stay here. It should hang here, your website will run separately. It will stick here. Now you know which position I am talking about. And here you have seen, there will be a logo here. You can use any logo. It should be circular. And this will be your layout. If anyone ever scrolls it, the layout will look something like this. I will make it a little bigger by the way. I will make it a little bigger. And let us say that our screen is so big that I am taking it up. Okay, you have to make it a little bigger. And as soon as you scroll, it will come. Then at the end, the footer will come. If you don't understand, I will tell you again. Don't worry. If you don't understand what I am talking about, how to make all this, then don't worry. I am telling you again. Okay, so see, your screen is, I will make a footer here first. Now it's okay. I made the footer like this. And yes. So this footer is here. Okay, and I will change the color of this footer. Why don't I make it white? Bring forward and I want to make it white. Not line, I want to make fill white. I want to make fill white. So this is our layout. Okay, it is a very basic, simple layout. I will make it a little like this so that the entire nav bar comes to the full width. And it will come like this. And why don't we give a little gap here? I have changed the layout a little, by the way. But you have to make it like this, like I have shown you the final. Okay, so you have to make it like this. Now let's say your screen is so big. That is, it is coming from here to here. This circle should be hanging here. Always keep scrolling to the side. Then as you scroll, it will come. Welcome to Sigma Web Development Express. Then your footer will come. Okay, you have to keep your nav bar sticky. And it should be hanging on the lower right. Okay, and as you scroll, it will come. Then your footer will come. So I hope you understood this layout. Come on, design this layout. And we will meet in the coming videos. And I will show you by designing it. And I will also tell you whether you have designed it correctly or not. Okay, height and width, I am telling you again. That according to this, when you scroll the page, That is, the entire content should not come on the entire page. You have to scroll. That is, a scroll bar should be the height of your content. That by scrolling, this came, then this came here. Then the footer came. Okay, so make it according to this. I hope you understood. I hope you enjoyed it. And if you have not accessed the playlist of Sigma Web Development course, Do access it. And with that, sir, keep liking the video. If you like it, it motivates you. And I am updating the source code here. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Music."
