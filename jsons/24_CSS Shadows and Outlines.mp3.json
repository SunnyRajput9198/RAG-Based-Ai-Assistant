    "text": " Guys, we saw about margin and padding. In today's video, I'll tell you about outline. And also, I'll tell you how you can add shadows in CSS. We understood everything from the CSS box model. What is border, margin, padding and actual content. In this video, we'll explore shadows and outlines. It's fun throughout the course. You can write down Sigma patch op in the comment section. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro So guys, I'm in my computer screen. As you can see. I'll do the same thing that I've been doing for the last 23 videos. I'll make a folder named video24 to organize things. And I'll open it in VS Code. And today's topic is about shadows. How to add shadows. You can add shadows to any element. I'll quickly make an index.html file. And you can also add outlines. To add outlines, you have to use outline property. How is this outline different from border? Why will we use outline? So let's start with box shadows. First, we'll talk about shadows. What is in CSS? So, shadows are used in CSS. To add a shadow to any element. So, if I show you an example of this. It will look like this. I'll make a div here. div.box And I'll write I am a box in it. And I'll simply put style tag here. And I'll write .box here. And I'll write simply here. Border 2px Solid black let us say. And that's about it. I'll give a little padding. 34px And you can see here. It will look like this. Where is my preview button? I'll open it in the browser. And see, it will look like this. No surprises whatsoever. We did this much. And you all know about it. Now if I want to give a shadow in this box. So I'll use box shadow. And the syntax of box shadow is like this. Here you put horizontal offset. Here you put vertical offset. Here you put blur. Here you put spread. Then you put color. Then you put insert. Now what is this? Horizontal and vertical offset means how far the shadow will be. Then there is blur. The more value you give here, the more blur it will be. Then after this, you see here. Shadow size with expand and shrink. If you increase the spread, then the size of your shadow will be increased or decreased. Then you can define the color of the shadow here. And after this, how much you want to keep the shadow inside. That defines your insert. So if I copy it. And paste it here. I'll show you the shadow here. So you can see here. Box shadow. Box shadow. You can see here 5 pixels. 15 pixels. 5 pixels. And I have given this color here. If I make this color red. Or let's say I make it green. Then it will be green. If I show you here, then this is how box shadow looks. Now what I will do here. And I will request you too. If you want to preview changes. Then what you have to do is inspect. And here directly. I'll move my face away. So that you can see this. And focus here. Now you want to see inside this particular element. That my box shadow. I have given here. How do I handle it? Now you can see here. You can change all these values. And see, by changing them, your shadow is changing. You can see here. Now what I have done here. I have given Y offset and X offset. Now see, if I do this, it will go here. If I do this, it will go here. Now it's up to you where you want to put this shadow. Now when does shadow appear? Shadow appears when our light falls from one direction. That is, if the source of light is here. And let's say this is my object. So shadow will be made here. So if you want something like that. So you guys have to see shadow here. To see here. These values have to be adjusted in the same way. You don't confuse the shadow. You are from the border. You put it like this. So that you look like a shadow. Shadow means shadow. Now here you will come to the inset value. So you can change the inset value too. If you want a shadow inside. So you can do it like this. Now you see, as you do. By the way, the syntax of this will change. You have written here inset. 10 pixels, 8 pixels, 5 pixels. So this is the color of the shadow. So usually you can increase or decrease the blur from here. And this syntax will change. And what will happen by increasing the spread? It will spread as much as you increase the spread. Ideally, you would definitely want to keep the spread less. Because the shadow does not look natural. If you make the spread very unnatural. You don't need to keep this syntax. You can see here. That our syntax was. Horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur, spread, color and inset. Now let's talk about the text shadow. You can write this syntax like this. Now, along with the box shadow. You can also give text shadow. The way you have given the box shadow. You can also give text shadow. And here if I do the text shadow. In any text element. I will copy it. And I will copy the whole CSS. And here I will show you. If I have a paragraph. And I say text shadow. And I write lorem 34. And I write the CSS. So what will happen here? Text shadow will come. I have made a class. I made a class named text element. I made it with the name of text shadow. And here you see. The shadow has come in the text. I make this color red. So that you know what happens with the text shadow. Sometimes we want to visually. That our shadow comes in the text. And definitely if you want to change it. Then you can change it from here. For example, if I want. My text shadow. It is of purple type. And along with that. I want to hit a purple shade. Along with that my text shadow. It has come a little down. Something like this. You can see that it looks exactly like a shadow. And let's say I want to increase its blur. Or I want to keep the blur so much. That it is just seen a little. So I can set the value from here. And whoever will generate the syntax. I will take it back here. By copying. I never focus on running. Nor did I ever do it myself. I want to tell you that. There are tools in Google Chrome. See in the coming time. Whoever will learn to use tools. He will become a good web developer. Whether it is chat gbd or github copilot. Whatever the AI of the applet. You should know when to use which tool. And how to do it as much as possible in the shortest time. And it will define your value. Many people ask if AI will replace. It will not. But AI will replace those who do not know the tools. Know how to use. And indirectly AI will replace. I want to end this debate. AI will not replace directly. It will indirectly do it. Through smart people. AI will help smart people so much. That those who are not smart. Their work will be finished. I am just telling you the reality. What is there is there. AI will not replace anyone. AI is not a human. It has not happened yet. It will be seen sometime. See here. Text shadow has come. If I want to generate the text shadow. Because I did it with purple color. If it comes. Then I can do it like this. And whatever syntax is being generated here. I can use it. If I want to increase it. And if I want to increase the blur. Text shadow is not used much. I have seen it. People use it. It looks good. But yes. I have not seen much usage. To be honest. But you should know about this property. Now last but not the least. Outline. You put the width. You put the style. You put the color. Just like we say to make a border. What is the difference in border? Assume this is my element. I will put outline. I will say outline 2px solid black. It looks like a border. What is this? I will put border also. 2px solid green. Border will be inside. Outline will be outside. There is a basic difference between border and outline. What is it? Outline does not take your space. It is not a part of the box model. Border is there. You can use outline offset property. Outline offset. Like this. You can increase the outline offset. Like this. The distance of the outline will increase. But you can not increase the distance of the border. Yes there is a margin. There is padding. It will affect the box model of the element. But like this. Like I am playing. You can not play with the border. You can not reduce it. You can not do inside and outside. You can do inside and outside. Sometimes you have to use outline to cover an element. Sometimes you have to use outline to cover an element. These are the basic differences. Outline is given in extra. If you have set the border. If you have set everything. If you want an outline after that. You can use outline. Then borders can have varying widths. Outlines have uniform width. You can not change the width of the outline. Then you can. You can use border radius. I am using border radius property. Because this is a property. Border radius. Suppose I do 34 pixels. Then you can see. As soon as I set the border radius. It became curvy. You can not curve the outline. Outline will follow the border. As soon as you set the border radius. Outline will take the curve. I hope you understood this. This was a very basic concept. Box shadow, text shadow and outline. I hope you understood. If you have not yet accessed. The sigma web development playlist. Then do access it. If you are not accessing the source code. Then I will recommend you. If you are coding together. Nothing can be better than that. But if you need code. Or if nothing is working. Then you can visit this repository. You can visit this repository. And it will help you a lot. Since I started this course. Many people from the industry. What can I say. They have felt bad. Many people approached me. To make it paid from the middle. But I am never going to do that. This sigma course will be free. So don't worry. But I want to tell you one thing. We are going to raise the bar like anything. Once we start making projects. You will enjoy it. And I can proudly say. Based on your feedback. And people from the industry also contacted me. That what have you made. Our sales have stopped. I am not against paid courses. If I am able to bring this course free. Then it is my good luck. And I will say that if anyone in the industry. Is giving you 99% paid. And 1% free. Then respect them. I want to give a shout out to everyone. You should actually be supportive. You should support them. Instead of saying that he is giving free. Then you should also do it. We all have to understand this. But the sigma web development course is free. And we are going to raise the bar like anything. We are going to make amazing projects. And it will be free till the end. I will not break my promise. Because I had promised from the first video. That this course is free. That is my promise. If I break that then it is wrong. I hope that if anyone is giving paid course. Then nothing wrong in that. In my opinion. I hope you also think the same. So that's it for this video. In the coming videos. We are going to see a lot of things. And the best is yet to come. We have not raised our bar yet. We will make good projects. I will tell you new things. I have learned from years of experience. I wish someone would have told me. I wasted so many years. You can guess the result. So that's it for this video. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Till then bye."
