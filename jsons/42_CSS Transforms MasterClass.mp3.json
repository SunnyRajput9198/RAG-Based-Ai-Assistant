    "text": " In today's video, I will tell you about CSS transforms. There are two types of transforms on CSS. One is 2D transform and the other is 3D transform. 2D transform means we want to change any object in two-dimensional space. Like we can increase its scale, we can translate it, we can rotate it. 3D transform on the other hand works on three dimensions. That is, we have an additional axis, z-axis. Because of which we can manipulate an object in three dimensions. Don't get confused about how these things are done. Just like the video and write Sigma Batch OP in the comment section below. And I will explain everything else in this video. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro So guys, I have come to my computer screen. And here I have already prepared for you. And the thing I am going to show you here is going to be fun for you too. So first of all, we will take a very basic start. I will make an index.html here. I will put a template on the boiler. There is a very basic thing, CSS transform. So I will tell you about it. So let's say I have a div, which has a container. There is a box inside it. I will give some styles to the box. And first of all, I will give it a height. I will give it a width of 50 pixels. I will give it a background color of 50 pixels. I will give it a border of 2 pixels. Solid black. Let's see its preview. And its preview looks like this. Now let's say that our box is inside the container. So I will give the container a width of 100 pixels. I will give it a height of 80 pixels. And I will give it a border of the same color. I will change the border color of the bus. Purple. So here in the box of the border of purple color, I have got this. Very good. Now let's see what the transform property does. The transform property applies some transforms in the element. The first transform I want to show you is rotate. Let's say I want to rotate the box. So I will put a transform property here. I will say transform. And I will say rotate. Now in rotate, you can see that it is rotate, rotate 3D, rotate x, rotate y, rotate z. First of all, I show you rotate. Let's say I want to rotate it by 40 degrees. So it will rotate by 40 degrees. I will do one more thing. I will write a box in it. So that you can see the box here. And if you want things to be centered in it, you know what to do. Display flex, justify content center, online item center. Now you can see that the box will come in the center. And I have rotated it. If I want, I can do it by 45 degrees. I can do it by 40 degrees. That's my choice. But there is another unit here, which is famous, which is turn. I say 0.25 turn. If 360 degrees is one turn, then I want to rotate it by 0.25 turn. So it has rotated by 90 degrees. And here you can see that it has turned by 90 degrees. If I turn it by 0.5 turn, then you know that it will rotate by 180 degrees. And one turn means that it will rotate by 180 degrees. That is, 360 degree rotation. Then here we can rotate it around an axis. Like I can say here transform. And I can write transform here. Rotate. Suppose I want to rotate it. Rotate x. So it will rotate around the x-axis. And suppose I write here 40 degrees. I can write 40 deg here. And I will write it like this. And you see that it will rotate by 40 degrees in x. I have not put a semicolon. Now you see that it has rotated by 40 degrees in x. Now when I say it has rotated in x, it has rotated around the x-axis. That is, if this is my x-axis, and this is my y-axis. And z-axis is inside this screen. So it is z-axis. Now here you can think that this is my box. Which was kept like this. I will show you on full screen. If this is my box like this. And this is my x-axis. So it will rotate around the x-axis. Or it will rotate like this. So according to that, if I give it a 90 degree rotation around the x-axis, then it will become paper thin. And you will not see it. And if I do rotate y here, then it will rotate like this. And if I want, I can rotate it just 90 degrees. Now you see that it will rotate a little bit. Around the y-axis. And if you rotate around the z-axis, then it will also rotate. You can also rotate z. It will rotate around the z-axis. Such that your axis is going inside the screen. So see it will rotate on this plane. Because the axis is going inside the screen. I hope you understood this. So this is our rotate property. After this comes the scale property. You can also make it bigger or smaller in scale. For example, if I remove it. And I write here transform. And I write here scale. So see we have a lot of options in scale. And I have one option. 1.5 or 1.6 times scale. So see it has increased by 1.6 times. And if I want it to be bigger in x, then I can scale x. If I want it to be bigger in y, then I can scale y. And in the same way, our other scale properties work. You just have to write scale. And you can do it in scale 3D. When you do scale 3D, then a 3D transformation is applied. And now I will tell you about skew. And if I assume skew, I will do it, let us say 5 degrees. So I will show you by semicolon. And as soon as I skew it from 5 degrees, it will be skewed. Skew means, suppose someone pulled it from here and here. Put a force like this and put a force like this. So it will be skewed. You can also do skew in y-axis. You can write y-axis, you can do 34 degrees. But there is no skew in z-axis. So you have to remember this thing that you cannot do skew in z-axis. Okay. So skew is not applied for z-axis at all. So I will remove skew from here. And I will show you that you can also translate. Translate is the most used property. I am telling you from my experience. Suppose I say 34 pixels. So see, it will be translated from 34 pixels. Okay. If I say 34%, then its width will be translated from 34%. If I say 100%, then it will be translated from 100%. And I can also translate it in x. And I can also translate it in y. Now see here, if I translate it in y, then it will come down. Now sometimes what happens is that we have to apply more than one transform properties. And when we have to apply more than one transform properties, then what we will do? Then we can apply it simply from spaces. Suppose I want to skew it too. I want to skew x. Let us say 40 degrees. And I also want to translate x. And I will say translate x. And I will say it is safe 45%. So all three transform properties have been applied at the same time. See, it has been translated. It has been skewed in x and y. Whatever I will put here, it will be done. Okay. I hope you understood how you can apply multiple transform properties. Now when is the use of transform done? Mainly it is done when we are making a navbar from here. And I want the navbar to be hidden. So I can translate it to minus 100 pixels. I can do minus 100%. So it will come out from here. See, it has come out of y. So we can do something like this. If I do star here in this way, I say star and I say m0 and I say p0 here. And by putting margin padding 0, I have done this. So it has gone up. So we can do something like this. I did minus 100% in translate y. If I do minus 45% in translate x, then it will go in the negative direction. Where is my minus button of the keyboard? I have pressed it. See, it has gone in the x-axis. So you can do something like this. Now there is another property, transform origin. What is this? Now I will tell you what it is. Suppose I rotate it by 0.5 turns. From where and about will it rotate? I will make it 0.25 so that it turns only from 45 degrees. Sorry, 0.125 will have to be done for 45 degrees. So see, it is turning from 45 degrees. And if I show you that the rotation point is its center. So basically my box is here. The default property of transform origin is 50-50. It is the center. Now suppose I make it 0-0. I say that this is my 0 and this is also my 0. So this rotation will be about this point. I will show you. I will change it to degrees. Suppose I make it 55 degrees. So as soon as I increase this number, you see the rotation is about this point. About 0-0 which is the origin. Now as soon as this value increases, which is 0%, suppose I make it 10%. Our origin is increasing. Now our rotation will be about this point. As you can see. So our rotation will be about this point which you are seeing on your screen. This point in this box means if I don't put a transform in it, then from here 10% and from here, suppose I write 50%, then at the halfway point the rotation point will come. Wherever its coordinates will come, it will rotate about that point. I hope you understood this. It is used when you want to rotate about a particular point. But it is an advanced concept. It is used less. I will tell you this too. After this, I want to show you a special thing. I hope you understood all these things. I have made an exhaustive list of demos. In this, I have put a style.css. Let's preview it. You will know. See here, I have tried to cover all our transforms. See here, scale x scales like this. Scale y scales like this. Scale will do something like this in both x and y. Translate x will do like this. Translate y will do like this. Translate will do like this. If there is a value in both x and y, and you want to see which value is there, then you can see from here. I have not told you the transition yet. I will tell you that. So you wait for the transition. Matrix transformation is this. Rotate is this. Skew is this. Skew x is this. Skew y is this. Matrix 3D is this. Translate 3D is this. Rotate will be like this. Which axis is about to rotate? Y axis. See here, it rotates about x axis. When we rotated it at 90 degrees, it disappeared. Translate z will do like this. It will seem to go down. I have translated it in both x and y. So that you can see that it is entering inside the screen. But you can see what is going on here. Now our monitor is a 2D screen. But these transform properties make it seem that our rotation is happening in 3D. So the CSS is made like this. Such that you understood the demo well. I have put together the demo in such a way that you can see in the comment and find out what is going on here. So I hope this demo will be helpful for you. Try these properties yourself. I hope you will enjoy after seeing all this. If you have not accessed the Sigma web development playlist, then access it now. Either click here to bookmark it or click here to save it.
