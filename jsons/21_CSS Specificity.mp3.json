    "text": " In today's video, I will tell you about specificity in CSS. Assume you have an element that has been styled in two ways through CSS. That is, we have used two types of selectors to style it. And both styles are saying two different things. Let's say one style is saying make the background color red. And the other style is saying make the background color yellow. Which one will be applied? This thing will be determined with the help of specificity in CSS. In this video, I will tell you all the rules. How does specificity work in CSS? Do write Sigma Batch OP in the comments below. Let's go to the computer screen and let's roll the intro. Intro I have entered my computer screen. And today's video is going to be important because in today's video, I am going to tell you. How is it decided which of the conflicted classes is which? Which property value will be applied in CSS? I will quickly make a folder named video 21 here. And I will open it in my VS Code. I will make index.html. And I will start this video with a question. The question I am going to ask you is that, Let's say you have a div in it. You have this h1. And in this h1, it is written CSS. Oops, I pressed the control s by mistake. Specificity. Let's say it is written. And I have added two classes in it. Let's say yellow. One c red. One c purple. I have added three classes. Now I put style here. And I say that the color of h1 is red. Or do aqua. And after this, I say that the yellow is our class. Dot yellow. On its basis, color it yellow. And along with that, the c red class is ours. Color red. And along with that, our c purple is dot c purple. According to that, the color is purple. So I put it here. And I will click here to show you. That its color is purple. It is applied in it. On what basis was purple color applied? Why didn't it turn yellow? Because I gave color aqua in h1. I gave color according to dot yellow. Then I gave color according to c red. Did purple apply because it was below? Or purple applied because it is a class here? This is a class. On what basis do things get decided in CSS? I will tell you today. See, if I put h1 below. And now I show, it is still purple. So what is it that is deciding? What color, what conflicting property will be applied? So here I want to tell you. That in CSS, there is an algorithm. Its name is cascade algorithm. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. And to resolve any kind of conflicts. Cascade algorithm is used in CSS. This algorithm determines. Which property will be applied in CSS. And which will not be done. Now see here we have a lot of. Color properties have been applied. In the same element in different ways. Which property will win here? Which will be the winning property? This cascade algorithm determines. So there are four rules in cascade algorithm. At a very high level. The first rule says that. Position and order of appearance are important. If you have kept the position of anything later. For example, here you saw that. The H1 is kept above. And you saw here. The dot C purple was applied. If I put the dot C red later. Then it will be applied. That is, they are using the class selector. And these three are using the class selector. So these three are equal in a way. So even after using the class selector. The one that is the lowest. That is, the one that is the last. Like the variable is overwritten in programming languages. In the same way, it can also be overwritten. If the same type of selector is there. Okay, then look here. If C is red, then the color will be red here. C red will be red later. But where the way of the selector changes. Specificity is used there. Now what is this specificity? Specificity is calculated. For a particular selector. I will tell you this. So let's understand the position and order of appearance first. What is the effect of position? See what you will write later. If the same selector is there. If you are using the element selector. And you are using only the class selector. So what will happen later will win. Suppose I was not using this. I will comment it out. So dot yellow, dot C purple and dot C red. He will win, which is the last. If I do dot yellow first, then he will win. That is, if the selector is of the same type. Like class selector, ID selector. Or any one. Means all three are the same type of selectors. So in all three, the conflict will be resolved. Which is later. So the one who was later, won. Here it is yellow. But where we change the selector. Like I make it ID selector. Or I make it an element selector. Like H1. So here we use specificity. Now the specificity of all this will be calculated. What is specificity? I will tell you what specificity is. Specificity is basically calculated as a value. Specificity says. Which CSS selector is the most specific. Like. Here I show you. So ID selector. Which is considered the most specific. But more specific than that. Inline style is considered. If you have put inline style. Means style is equal to. So that will be considered as a mantra. Like I tell you. If I. Style is equal to. Color blue. So the thing is over. Style attribute is the most priority. So it will not even see. What you have written in CSS. Color will apply blue. Now if I show you. If I remove this. Then it will come to specificity. Which is the most specific selector. Specificity of all will be calculated. Now how to calculate specificity. I will show you. If you have very simple selector. Like inline style. Is given the most priority. After this comes. ID selector. If anything is selected from ID. That is the most specific. Means if you have put in ID. Then it will be applicable. More than if you have put in class. Or if you have used attribute selector. What is attribute selector. I will tell you. Let's say. Area. Or I put something like this. Data x is equal to 1. Or data x is equal to a. I will tell you. Where data x value. What I will say. Data x value is a. I will put equals to a. What I will do there. Background color will be red. So data x is equal to a. I will show you. Background color is red. This is attribute selector. Means I am saying. That element where data x value is a. This is attribute selector. I was telling you. So most specific will be inline styles. After that will be ID selector. After that will be class or attribute selector. Then element selector. Then universal selector. So you will always try. Use specific selector. Why? Because it will be easy to overwrite. Like I have written any style. By using universal selector. Now I am in mood to overwrite. So I will use element selector. I want to overwrite this too. I overwrote it by using class or attribute selector. I want to overwrite this too. I overwrote it by using ID selector. But where I used inline style. It will be difficult to overwrite. Then what will I do? This thing gives a little problem. So here you see. The position matters. If there is only one type of selector. Selector is exactly the same. Specificity is exactly the same. So you will see the position. Specificity will be applied later. I will teach you exact value. But I have told you at a high level. Inline style is their priority. Then after that. If you have used ID selector. Then class selector will be given priority. Then comes origin. The order in which CSS appears. And where it comes from. Now here origin is very important. Because if your. CSS is coming from your browser style. Because if you have not applied CSS in any element. Then the browser will not be able to see it. If you have not applied CSS. Then the browser has its own style sheet. Which is called user agent style sheet. If I write here. And inspect it. Then assume this is the effect of position. So here some styles are coming from the user agent style sheet. I will show you here. Now see the user agent style sheet. This means that the browser has put it. So where is it coming from? What is its priority? If you have written the style. Then they will overwrite the user agent style sheet. This is very important to know about it. After this comes importance. If you have put importance somewhere. Then it will be the most important. So what will happen if you have put importance? Then it will be very important. And then it will have to be applied. That is, it will overwrite the inline styles. Like if I have made its color inline styles. Assume red. Style is equal to. If I have colored it. I have its aqua. I do not do aqua. I do maroon. Now if I have to overwrite it. Then only one thing can be overwritten. That is important in CSS. If I do it like this. Color blue. Actually I am putting it on the style of the element. That is, I am putting inline styles in it. That's why it is changing here. But I will reload it. And what will I do here? The class that is not being applied in it. As you know, I put it here. If I do color blue. Color blue is important. That is, the yellow one in my class. I put color blue important. And if I do it here. Important. So it will be blue. So the most important thing is that it will overwrite the inline styles. So this is specificity. In this video. In the coming time, I will tell you a note. It is a very important note. And it is so important. That you will also clap. You have said a lot of knowledge. So I want to tell you. How to do specificity calculation of any particular element. I want to tell you. This is very important. Now in specificity calculation. You give 0 points to the universal selector. If there is an element selector or pseudo element. Then give it 1 point. If there is a class selector, attribute selector or pseudo class. Then give it 10 points. After this, give 100 points to the ID selector. Give 1000 points to inline styles. So according to these values. You will give points. Now it becomes easy to solve. I will tell you how. Suppose. You have to calculate. How much specificity is there. So how will you do. You can see here. We have different types of selectors. I told you. How much specificity is there in the element selector. You give it 1. If there is a universal selector, then give it 0. And the element selector. You give it 1. The specificity of this. Is 1. I will comment it here. I will give it 1. Then the class selector. What is its specificity. It is 10. And same goes for this. It will also be 10. I will copy it easily. It will also be 10. I will document it. I will write here. This is an example of. Example of. Attribute selector. And the specificity of the attribute selector. What will happen. The specificity of the attribute selector. Is 10. Element attribute selector. Is 10. I told you this. Now you will see. Whose specificity is the most. The most specificity of these three. There is a tie in these three. To break the tie. The color of the tie is different. The yellow is coming after all. I will remove the inline styles. I have kept inline styles to give you an example. You can see here. The color of the tie. I will preview it. If I make any of these below. For example, I make this C red below. Then obviously its color will be red. No surprise is there. Its color will be red. No surprise. You will not get any gift. Here. This is an example of attribute selector. I will do one thing. Its specificity is 10. I want to show you one thing. I will maroon the color. Now you guys write to me in the comment section. What color will H1 get. Everyone tell below. And please comment. Because two way interaction is happy from the heart. Your comment makes the day. Especially when you solve problems. Then my day is made. You are following things. So tell me in the comment section. What color will be of this H1. I hope you all have commented. And you have commented correctly. If you said maroon. Because the specificity is 10. But if I make it up. Cut it from here. Then what will happen. Then what will happen. If you said red. Then obviously it will be red. Why will it be red. Because its specificity is 10. And because its specificity is 10. Then what we will do. We will make its color red. Because it is coming after all. Now I tell you one thing. And listen to this very carefully. Because it is very important. These are simple selectors. But the selectors are not always simple. You also know this. Sometimes selectors are like this. A.C red. And inside it paragraph. So we have complex selectors. How to calculate their specificity. I will tell you. To calculate their specificity. You have to simply add values. Like I write here. H1.yellow. So because of H1. How much will be its specificity. Because H1 is an element. It will be 1. And because of dot yellow. Its specificity will be 10. So 1 plus 10 is 0. And here its specificity will be 10. So 1 plus 10 is 11. Now here its specificity has increased. So now the color will be yellow. Now because its specificity has increased. So the color will be yellow. Why? Because because of element. It got 1. And because of class. So it got 10. So this way. Specificity values are calculated. For any selector. So you can see. If you have seen this video. And you are watching this video. So I need your focus more. So I will recommend. Watch this video again. If you didn't understand. Because I have explained things very well. And I will give you the link of this video. In the description. You can read this tutorial. I have explained this very well. So you can read this too. And you don't need to remember values. I was thinking that I will tell you one thing. That thing is also coming. But here you have seen. Inline styles have 1000 specificity. And if you put important. Then its specificity will be added to 10,000 points. If you put important. And it becomes very difficult to overwrite it. So I hope you have understood all these things. Now I have given a quick quiz here. That its. Specificity value. Please don't cheat. I have also given a solution in this. So tell me what will happen. If there is such a class. Tell me quickly by commenting. Pause the video. Because I will solve it directly. But you tell me. What will be its specificity. And here I will definitely change the color. And I will make the color. Blue violet. And I hope you are understanding. I am waiting for your comment. So I hope you have commented. So let's calculate its specificity. What will be the specificity due to A. Specificity due to A. Because it is an element. Then due to class. 10. Due to Rohan class. Then here. Href is given. This is an attribute selector. And it says if H1. If I have written H1 here. I told you the attribute selector. If you have written data x is equal to A. It means that the value of data x is A. But if you have taken only data x. It means that if data x is given in the element. Then. It means that if Href is given. Then. After this. Attribute selector. Which is 10. As I told you. It will get one more 10. And here I told you. Due to pseudo class. It gets 10. So here it is plus 10. So its specificity is 41. I hope you all got 41. If you got 41. Then it is absolutely correct. And the more specificity. The more specific this style will be. And the probability of its application. Is more. If there is no specificity anywhere. That is, the one who targets this element. No other selector is so specific. Then what will happen. Then the same. Properties will be applied. So 41. And I have explained its solution here. Why did 41 come. And I have given values here. How much value is obtained from whom. Now I will tell you what I was talking about. I told you about specificity. I told you what is important. I also told you. How specificity is calculated. I told you all this. And I have to tell you one thing. Whenever you write your CSS classes or styles. Ensure that you. Do not leave any confusion in the mind of any reader. Or in the mind of a fellow programmer. Why do you have to target any element again and again. Why do you have to write classes. You are saying that the color of H1 should be red. And you are saying for the same class element. That this thing should happen. Why do you have to do this. Make your website simple. If you have targeted someone with ID. Then you are sure. That I will not need to overwrite it. That's why I am using such a specific selector. Avoid inline styles. It is possible only with importance. And avoid the important. Because we do not want to go so specific. In our web pages. You try to use classes. So that you can reuse. And whatever properties are inside those classes. You have to apply. So you can apply easily. I hope you are understanding. What I want to say here. But if you give an interview to web dev. Then these things are asked. And this is what is trapped. I wanted to tell you. You should know what is cascade algorithm. These are the four things. On which it decides. What property value pairs to apply. So you should understand all these things. This was very important from the theory point of view. If you have not liked the video. Then like the video. Access this playlist. Click and bookmark. Click and save. Share with your friends.
