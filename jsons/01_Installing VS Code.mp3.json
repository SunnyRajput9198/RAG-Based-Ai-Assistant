    "text": " From today's video, we will start the Sigma Web Development course. Like this video with high energy, because in this video, I am going to make you a profitable web developer from zero. This course will be very modern because web development has changed over time. A lot of new things have come, a lot of things have come in JavaScript that make work very easy. A lot of technologies have come that will make your work very easy. This course will be for those people who know nothing. You know zero if this course is for you about web development. We will start from zero, but in the future we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course, I will tell you in a while. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And I believe that you can also be very successful by learning web development. During the course, you will be given notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because I will tell you all the technologies that you should learn according to your experience in this course. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. The course content will be complete web development, front-end, back-end, database. I will teach you as much as you want to learn. I will tell you what exactly the course content will be in a while. But you guys have faith that I will make you a full-stack developer. A lot of projects will be done for you in the course. And at the end of the course, we will make some good projects. So that your grip on web development can become very strong. According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn. That's why I will make a lot of projects for you. And if you agree, then write in the comment section below, I agree. Because when you comment, I get a smile on my face. So do comment. I want to assure you that after finishing this course, you will be able to make any kind of website from start to end. And during this course, I will make a lot of websites for you so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma web development course. Let's roll the intro. Intro Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen. And now follow me as I am doing. I have downloaded the Google Chrome browser here. You also download the Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it will not work. But you guys have to do exactly the same as a beginner. What I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly as I am doing. And as the videos come along, you will be able to follow exactly. I will go to Google quickly. And I will write here. Download VS Code Now what is this VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system. Then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process will be exactly the same. You can see that VS Code has come here in my Downloads folder. And here you can see that this setup has been downloaded. I will refresh here. And here you can see that I can double-click the VS Code setup and install it. So simply install VS Code. It is as easy as installing a game. You read the agreement quickly here. This license applies to... Damages And after this I will accept the agreement. You also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. I am the fastest reader in the world. Next we will do. It is important to check both icons here. It is very important to check both icons. Check it. If you want a desktop shortcut. That is, if you want to get a shortcut on the desktop here. Click on the Create a Desktop icon. And after this we will do next. Then we will install. If your PC is fast like me, then it will be this fast. But if your PC is slow. Then there is no problem. It will be a little slow install. Nothing more than this will happen. Now here I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because these videos. I want you to follow exactly. As soon as I put the video, you get a notification. So if you want to follow this course completely. Ideally you should subscribe. With that said, our VS Code has been downloaded. I have opened my VS Code. Don't be afraid to see this. Beginners, don't be afraid to see this. And I am saying this again. If you already know things. We are taking a beginner friendly start here. In the initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything. In the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. Hi. Okay, I will request you guys. Tell me in the comment section. What is your level? Are you a beginner, advanced or an intermediate user? Tell me in the comment section. How much do you know about web development? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please. You guys do comment. Now what is VS Code here? Why did we download it? Let's understand this. So if you are a beginner. You don't know what VS Code is. Let me tell you that VS Code is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now you will say. Harry, I can edit code in notepad. So yes, do it in notepad. It will also happen. Yes, I am not saying sarcastically. It will happen in that too. Here we set it up. And show what is in it. Which makes it a little different from notepad. Look here. We set it up quickly. I will not browse here with color themes. In fact, I do it. I keep dark modern here. My theme. And I did all this. Next section. After this next section. If you want, you can also close this welcome. But again here are some tips. Telling you. That's it. This is your VS Code here. It has started. This is the screen of VS Code. You can see. You can make a new file here. You can make a new folder. But I will recommend you. That you close it. Yes, you close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep it in its name. You guessed it right. Sigma Web Development Course. And we will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything. Means understand. We will do related to the course. We will not do much. Now here you will press shift and right click. If you are in windows. So you can see here. That an option called open with code is coming. This option called open with code. Helps you to open this particular folder in VS Code. You will select it here. Now what will you do here? You will say yes I trust this file. Click on it here. Yes I trust the authors. And this folder has now opened. Means if I click on plus. To make a new file. Suppose I have written here. Index.html Write it now. Even if you don't know what I am writing. Write it. Hit enter. And after this. What will I do? That I will write here. Hey I am your first html file. Suppose I have written this. Here you can see this dot. This dot is white in color. This dot means. That you have not saved this file. Please save it. Hit ctrl s. It will be saved. I will recommend you. That you go to the file. And enable the auto save option here. So as you type. You will not see this dot. Your file will be saved instantly. As you type. And I also recommend this thing. We will not use ctrl s. Otherwise if you want to save with ctrl s. Then you can disable this option. One more thing I would like to do with you. You click on gear here. Then click on settings. And search here mouse. Mouse. Now see here. Editor mouse wheel zoom. Check this. What will happen by checking this? I will tell you. Check this and close it in settings. Now you don't have to be afraid. What is VS code? Why is VS code? How is it? What is this? Why is this? What is this news? Yes, but you don't have to see all this. Now you will simply press ctrl. And scroll like this. So what happens? That your font size. It changes. Now I will show you a magic. What is magic? It is a very simple logic. That here in downloads. In the folder named sigma web development course. What happened? That this file was made. Index dot html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. Suppose I make a file named this dot txt. I will write this is this. So what will happen? This file will be made here too. So this folder and this VS code. Both are running in sync. Now if I open this file from here. From the notepad. And I will show you. My file is opened in the notepad. So I can do that too. That is also my choice. But I will not use the notepad. Because there are some things in VS code. Which notepad does not give me. And I want that I get those features. I do not want to overwhelm you. But I show you. What is there in VS code? Which you do not get in the notepad. If I write here. Suppose html. If I hit enter. Then it automatically. It gave me the opening and closing tag. If I hit the exclamation mark here. Then it gives me a boilerplate template. If I click on it. Then see the basic code of html. It came here. We will discuss about it later. Now you do not get overwhelmed by it. But I want to tell you. How it is beneficial in VS code. Why we did not use notepad. Why we used VS code. And this feel comes. We are getting such a good feel. The developer's feel is coming. The hacker's feel is coming. That feel is also important. That is why the confidence will come. To do coding. Now for mac and linux users. I want to comment here. Exactly similar things are going to happen. For you too. I am using windows. Because I have a windows laptop. I can not use three laptops. I can not use linux, mac and windows. I can not use all three at once. So for you. Exactly the same things will be there. In fact I should say. Similar things will be there. Not exactly the same. Very similar things will be there. So you can follow along. Very easily. So do not take tension. I will tell you about some extensions. And you will enjoy. By using those extensions. And you will also say. It is fun. What did you recommend. But I will tell you in a while. And this is criminally underrated. I am telling you. You will enjoy. I would like to tell you before that. You will click on the right. Click on the command palette. So here are a lot of options for VS code. You do not need to know all these options. As we move forward in the course. Whatever feature. As it comes into use. I will keep telling you. And you guys use it. But what I will do here now. I will toggle a screencast mode. You do not have to do this. But I will do. You will know what will happen. I clicked. So you see I will type anything. If I press caps lock. So here caps lock will come. So you will know. Which button I pressed when. Now this thing is for you. Not at all relevant. But I just want to tell you. What is the screencast mode. What is the screencast mode. We can change its settings from here. Now here you see. Screencast mode's vertical offset. What does vertical offset mean? If I make vertical offset zero. So it came up. If I make vertical offset 70. So it came down. I will make it 60. I will make it 60. If I give space here. So it came here. If I make it 80. So it came here. That is. From bottom how much will it look up. So I made it zero. In fact I made it one. Now I will type anything here. Suppose I did this. It will show you at the bottom. Which is ideal. So what I will do is. I will close this file. I will close the settings tab. These are tabs basically. Like tabs in chrome. Your tabs are exactly the same. So I hope you know. What is it? What we have written about it. You will forget. I will tell you step by step. What is exactly what is it? You can also close the welcome page. Of VS Code. By any chance. If you want to zoom in on VS Code. Which I will do. Because I am recording a video. Now add control plus. Add the plus of numpad. Look below. I have shown you. I am zooming in. I am zooming in because. I am recording videos. So ideally I would like. That you can see the screen from close. But when I am doing my coding. Then I don't zoom in so much. Because you have to keep this thing in mind. So these are related to VS Code. Now I want to tell you. How do websites work? A website basically. Works through three types of people. Imagine three people. One is client. One is server. Who is client? Who is the other? Server. Who is the third? Browser. Who is also called Babu brother. Browser. So browser, client, server. What is this client? What is this server? What is this browser? I am the client. You. All of us. Who use a browser. Who is the browser? This is Chrome. Hello Chrome. I am the client. I will tell the client. When I write codewithharry.com. Suppose I write codewithharry.com. So what I basically say? I say. From this browser. Please give me codewithharry.com website. Or if I write here. Youtube.com I say. Give me youtube.com website. I say. Browser. Give me youtube.com. I want to see youtube. What does the browser say? You want youtube? Take this. So here. I will enter youtube.com. So from the server. Youtube.com. He brought it. Are you understanding? From the server. Youtube.com. He brought it. He showed me this screen by parsing. This work happened so soon. Because my internet.com. Internet.com. Internet speed is very fast. It is so less. Nowadays people are even faster. But still. According to my locality. It is very fast. Okay. So with this fast internet speed. All these things are very fast. So the client sends a request to the server. Through the browser. Browser is the client. That is my assistant. Whatever I say from the browser. He will do that. Will help me. From the server. To bring this web page. Who is managing the server? Server is being managed. Youtube. Youtube.com. Server is being managed. And inside that server. Some code is written. Which sends me. This kind of code. That is when I write. Youtube.com. This code came. Now how to convert this code. This work is of the browser. That is how to show me. This work is of the browser. So the client says to the browser. Hey kid. Give me youtube.com. Browser says. Kid you want youtube.com. Wait I will ask for youtube.com. Youtube.com. Then the browser goes to the server. Means a request is sent to the server. Server says. Give me youtube.com. Server will either give it. Or will say no. Or will say error. Or will say that the server has been errored. Whatever response will be. Ideally it should be 200. Response code is 200. With that response. Our browser. Comes back to the client. And shows this kind of page. I hope this is clear to you. Client. Browser. Server. So client to the browser. Browser to the server. Back to the browser. So this is how this thing works. This thing is a little more important. I will tell you once again. When you write google.com. Any website google.com. So client. Says to the browser. Give me google.com. Browser says. Hey teacher. You want google.com. Wait I will also bring it from the server. So goes to the server. Browser. And brings google.com. And gives you. You get google.com. Now with google.com. The server. All images. All videos. Whatever things are there. It sends all. Like these icons. These icons. The URL is also written in this code. And that too. The job of the browser. To display us properly. So the server. It sends a whole bundle to the browser. Sends this kind of bundle. And by passing this bundle. Showing like this. The job of the browser. Now whatever further interaction. User with this page. Browser will give additional request. If I do right click. And inspect. And then I go to the network. And here I write. Assume. Harry bhai. Assume I wrote Harry bhai. So see so many requests. He sent for images. And many more requests. He sent. So as you interact. Similarly. More requests. Additionally. Will have to send. To the browser. So in total. You consider it like a restaurant. You gave the order. Means sent the request. As soon as you gave the order. Your order. A waiter took it. That waiter. Then went inside the kitchen. He sent your order. Kitchen you consider the server. And after this. Finally when the kitchen. Gave the order back. So what did this waiter do. Which is the work of the browser. That waiter. He gave you back the order. It is possible that the order. Is not made in the kitchen. For some reason. It is very rare. That you order something. And you did not get it. But it happens sometimes. Similarly here. Sometimes it happens. That error is seen. 404 error. Or 500 error. Server is not working. Such errors. So whenever such errors. Are seen. Then also you are told. That the server is not working. So that's why. You are told. That the server is not working. But ideally. 200. Means. Ok response. And you get. Such a webpage. So you can. Consider it. Like a restaurant. So whenever you write. Google.com. Slash mail. So if google.com. Slash mail is available. Then it will show you. And if you write. Codewithari.com. Slash contact. So codewithari.com. Slash contact. If it is available. Then it will show you. If it is not available. Then it will show 404. Or if there is 500 error. Then it will show you. A page with 500. Whatever server. Will send. So the server. Will send. Processed the request. After this. The server. Will send the data. Back to the browser. And whatever data. It sent. To the client. Then the client. Did something. Then the server. Sent a request. Then the server. Sent something. Whatever data. The server sent. It came back to the client. And so on. So now you will say. All this is fine. But what is this backend. What does backend mean? Backend is. How the server. Is processing the request. Now if you assume. That you have a blog. And there is a lot of data. So what will you do? You will store. Every webpage of the blog. Separately. Or you will. Generate that content. Dynamically. You will generate. That content. Dynamically. I take the example of Google. If I search for Harry. Then you can see here. That the header of Google. Is this. Links. This format. Does not change at all. If I write here. Assume. Shubham. Okay. Assume I wrote Shubham. So as soon as I write Shubham. Now see. When I wrote Harry. It has a very similar. Content. Google is showing me. So what does Google do? The server of Google. Its backend. Backend processes. Data in such a way. That he. Such HTML. For the corresponding query. Send. That is. When I write Shubham. Then send it. When I write Harry. Then send it. So the process of generating. This thing. Through which system. Is happening. That is the backend. Now this backend. Can be Django. This backend can be Flask. This backend can be. Nodejs. This backend can be PHP. This backend can be. Ruby on Linux. This backend can be. Ruby on Rails. And the database inside the backend. It is used. That is. The code of the backend. The client does not see. This is the frontend code. Which sends the server. And how did the server make this code? We do not know. Because this is running on the server. Code. If you are confused. Then do not be confused at all. You will understand all these things. We will see the backend. Now we understand. How does the frontend work? The frontend. It is primarily. Made up of three languages. HTML. CSS. And JavaScript. These three languages. Are used. To generate. The query. And the query. These three languages. Which are needed. If you are making a website. Every website. HTML. CSS. JavaScript. In most of the cases. It is needed. If you only use HTML. Then a very basic. The skeleton of the website. It is made. After that. When you use CSS. Then you can style it. Like this button. It looks like this. So only CSS. It is visible. Along with that. Here this button is visible. Here this button. It is seen as curved. It is all. With the help of CSS. This is what you are seeing here. Edges. It is all. With the help of CSS. So the work of CSS. Is to style a page. What will be the color of which button. What will happen by hovering. All these things. Are done through CSS. In a way. Beauty of CSS. HTML page. HTML is the existence. Body of any page. Something like this. It is a standard. Which is agreed. If anyone makes a website. Then he will make it on HTML. So that the browser makers. Will understand. How to parse. The work of the browser. Is to parse. HTML. And HTML. Is a skeleton. It is a standard. It is a standard. It is a standard. It is a standard. It is a standard. Anyone who makes a website in this world. He will make it in HTML. Skeleton. HTML will use. It is a standard. Such a standard. Has been made. So that. Everyone. Make the same type of pages. And if anyone is making a browser. Then the same language. Have to parse. If as a beginner. You have learned 80% HTML. Then you are good to go. For web development. Now. Some things happen directly from HTML. Like. If I show you. If I write a very quick HTML code. Then I am writing. HTML code in this way. By hitting the exclamation mark. I have. Here. I have written. I have used. Emmet abbreviation. You guys. Do not worry at all. How I wrote this code. I will write. Hey. This is HTML. And I. HTML file. Can open directly. Something like this. And as soon as I. HTML file. I will open directly here. You see. It will open in this way. I can open it directly. Actually. By double clicking. In this way. And it opened. Now see. Hey. This is HTML. But it is not styled at all. That is. This HTML file. It is very basic. I have an HTML file. Which I show you. With which you can run videos. I do one thing. That you guys. Change this HTML file. And show. Such that. We can show videos in it. So. There is a video tag in HTML. If you hit the video enter. So whatever video you put inside the SRC. It will be played. Like if I put here. Video 1. MP4. You see. VS code has automatically shown me. Video 1. MP4. This is the benefit. To use VS code. So you guys see here. I will reload it. So here this video. Automatically. I can play it. To play. I have to write controls here. And I will refresh it now. So I will get the controls to play. I can play. Dude. This ship has come. To sell. The man is in dire need. How does he want the case. He is asking for 130 crores. Final. Absolutely. Now if I put here. Video 2. MP4. I put video 1 here. I have two more videos outside. I have some more videos here. If I put it here. And after that. I refer them. If video 2. MP4. I put here. Video 2. MP4. I put here. Video 2. MP4. If I put video 2. MP4. Instead of it. Then video 2 will be seen. I will reload it and show you. What you bought. Why did you put it. So yes. Ben Stokes. I put it. And now. With my own hands. By working hard. Show people. What did you do. These were Ben Stokes. Lookalike. Now if I put here. Video 3. Assume I put here. Video 3. So my third video. That will run. So I will reload it. And you see. I can play it. Sir. Give me something to eat. So this third video. So I will turn it off. And this way. You can run video 4 too. And video 4. I have a DJ video. In which DJ is played. So you see. So you can make things like this. Only using HTML. That means you have. Nothing more. Need to do. Now you can play videos. You can play images. You can do it. With this kind of things. You can do it. Something. Just like this. You can do it. So you can do it. You can do it. You can do it. With this kind of things. Just like this. You can do it. You can do it. you can display it on the screen, all this can be done with HTML Now if you want to style it like suppose I want a border on it or this comes in the background of red color then what I have to do for that for that I have to use CSS and CSS adds beauty on any website then comes JavaScript which adds interaction to a website for example what will happen when I click on search what will happen when I write code with Harry like code with HR and here auto complete comes, why did it come it came because a request went on the server and for this query auto complete results came so all these things are done with JavaScript we call this client side scripting, means if we want to do scripting or coding on the client only on the client side then we can do it with the help of JavaScript this is brain too so our website becomes beauty with brain I am talking about the website, beauty with brain, beauty with CSS and brain with JavaScript now JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic easily, like without loading the page if you want to change the content then all this work is done with JavaScript here a lot of mosquitoes are coming so let me kill them they are not getting anything my racket is working like the video because I eat the snacks of current for you when I was in college I used to say that HTML, CSS, JavaScript learn one by one, first learn 100% HTML then learn 100% CSS, till you remember all the properties, then learn JavaScript but this assumption is wrong why is it wrong, because HTML you only 80% and CSS you only 40-60% and JavaScript you only 50-70% you can start web development, you can make projects and while making you can move ahead from there in this course, I will tell you what is the impact of chat gpt on web development so we will talk about this also so stay tuned so never run behind perfection with HTML, CSS, don't think I will do HTML for one year, then CSS then JavaScript in third year then in fourth year I will make projects, don't think like this do HTML 80% CSS 40-60% and JavaScript learn 50-70% you can make a very good website and as you keep making websites your experience will teach you more HTML CSS, JavaScript and you will not even know that you have perfected HTML, CSS, JavaScript while you are making money and working as a professional web developer so you are earning along with learning and along with that you are also improving your skills so don't think that I will make a website when I will remember all HTML tags when I will remember all CSS properties when I will learn all JavaScript I will teach you only that much and I don't want you to learn only for years that's why I have designed this course so that you can learn only those things which matter and you can learn other things from practice and I am going to teach you many practices in this course here to learn sigma web development course 2-4 mosquitoes have also come which is good, our audience is increasing in this course we will learn HTML first then CSS, then JavaScript and I will tell you such tricks in this course which you have not heard anywhere and I have learned different points of my career I have learned all the tricks I will tell you in this course I have learned some amazing tricks in my career and I want you to learn all these tricks as soon as you start now if you have any doubt in this course in the coming videos you can use the hashtag doubt and ask your doubt I am going to try to answer all the doubts I will try, my whole effort will be that your doubts are solved so if you have any technical question then you can put hashtag doubt and in these useless questions or in these useless comments do not put hashtag doubt so that I can prioritize the reply of the hashtag doubt I will try to answer all the doubts as much as I can and you will learn everything in this course so like this course if you have not done it yet that will bring a smile on my face so do it now what is react, nextjs, angular so see all these front end frameworks they help you to use JavaScript they help you to make HTML, CSS, JavaScript website they help you to make this process fast how? we will learn it in this course yes in this course I told you that I will make this course completely different I will make you from zero to hero in web development tie your seat belt because you have now bought the ticket of sigma web development express I want to give you a very good analogy to teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript HTML is just like car skeleton then I painted it in CSS and put it in internal engine car then it is JavaScript as an example of a human the skeleton is HTML then skin and everything is CSS and brain is JavaScript means the nervous system is JavaScript now I will take you to Forbes.com as soon as you go to Forbes then you see a website has opened Forbes.com is a website which uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript just like any other website now if I click on right click on inspect then inspect element is opened now you see here they have used script in head and to add CSS they have used link so I will remove their CSS so to remove CSS what I will do I will clear all their style tags by using delete key so as soon as I remove all their style tags and along with it I will remove all their link tags so as soon as I delete all their style sheets see what happened to this page this page is looking like this they have only raw HTML what should be the size of images and only raw HTML is written here which is not styled at all so Forbes.com is like this without CSS without CSS, it is showing only raw buttons raw text raw links and similarly I can see without JavaScript how this website will look now if I delete HTML tag of this page like this I have deleted head and all so this is a blank page without HTML, it is not even there so this is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in making a web page for your information this course was initially made to be paid but I changed my mood and converted it into a free course so I thought I will upload this on YouTube so I want you all to be serious many people have reached out to me to launch this course but I felt that this course should be free because when I was learning web development I can understand when you don't have a good course to learn well and you don't have affordability to buy a paid course so I can understand and I decided that this is a SIGMA web development course and it should be launched absolutely free this course is free but under this free scheme as you will earn millions in the coming time you will give me tea, coffee, parties and all the gifts this is our agreement in this video so when you start earning millions after this course then send me a green card or red card but you have to do this only when you start earning well only after you start earning good so just keeping you aside in the next video I will tell you how you can earn money to complete this course because this is also important how to get a job, how to earn money how I do freelancing how clients come I will tell you everything in this course I want to tell you some action items first action item is you have to access this course playlist which I will give you in the description everyone bookmark that playlist press star button to open that playlist and then bookmark and save button is also there now many of you said that the course is paid then also we will buy thank you so much for all the support I am very thankful to you but this course is going to be free now technical issues should not come I am putting these videos in 1080p so you should see it clearly but many people say that video is in HD 240p, 144p you watch Bali ka Vadhu you watch it from morning to evening and then you say that your videos are not HD call some municipality I hope you understood the request what is response how these websites work we got a basic idea how client-server interaction works in coming videos we will see how website is made we are going to make our first website so you should be very excited because in next video our first website is going to be made and may be that first website is yours so access the playlist thank you so much for watching this video and we will see you next time"
